28/01/2020, 7:25 pm - Saket (TSEC, CS): Guys today's q.
28/01/2020, 7:25 pm - Saket (TSEC, CS): All the elements of the input array will be consisting of '0' s and '1' s.
You have to output a single line 
With all the 1's and then remaining 0's of the input array.

Input format :
Take n,After that next line contains, n spaced integers i.e a1,a2...an  denoting the elements of the array.

Output format :
Print a single line consisting of length n.

Sample input:
6
0 1 0 1 0 1

Sample output:
1 1 1 0 0 0

Explaination :
As we can see there are 3 ones and 3 zeros in the input array,So output is accordingly.
28/01/2020, 7:29 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Just a note

28/01/2020, 7:30 pm - Chirag Sharma (TSEC, CS): Because if you reverse it. Write k first and then i
28/01/2020, 7:31 pm - Chirag Sharma (TSEC, CS): You get a totally different output
28/01/2020, 7:31 pm - Chirag Sharma (TSEC, CS): How???

28/01/2020, 7:47 pm - Saket (TSEC, CS): In-built
28/01/2020, 7:48 pm - Tushar Nankani: Because it enters the loop because of k. And i gets printed too.
28/01/2020, 7:49 pm - Tushar Nankani: The condition of k becomes true and therefore it enters the loop. From 2 to 20 with a gap of 2. Therefore it enters 10 times and i gets printed instead from 1-10
28/01/2020, 7:50 pm - Saket (TSEC, CS): So conclusion is
If there are multiple conditions in a single ' for loop' then even if one statement is satisfied then loop will run for that condition.
28/01/2020, 7:51 pm - Tushar Nankani: Yes. It's like any one of these conditions should be true. It's like using "OR". And not "AND".
28/01/2020, 7:51 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): But depends na

One more thing 

We've gotta manage our academics also along with coding 

I know pointers don't matter much

But getting a decent pointer is important.....

If you all can 
You'll should allocate specific time for coding....

29/01/2020, 10:47 pm - Saket (TSEC, CS): This is because 52 (i.e. 25) might be stored as 24.9999999 or 25.0000000001 because the return type is double. When assigned to int, 25.0000000001 becomes 25 but 24.9999999 will give output 24.
To overcome this and output the accurate answer in integer format, we can add 0.5 to the result and typecast it to int e.g (int)(pow(5, 2)+0.5) will give the correct answer(25, in above example), irrespective of the compiler.

29/01/2020, 11:43 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): darshan sir told us to avoid statements like break if possible since it causes halt in the flow of the program abruptly and causes voltage fluctuations  (just telling this to you),so just keep that in mind

29/01/2020, 11:48 pm - +91 99201 75875: Let's say this is true then you could use the same logic and instead of writing it in main(),  make a separate function which just returned a Boolean and in the if statement replace break with return false and return true if the entire loop executes 
And in main just call the function with the user input int

else in the room. Given the fact that any two persons shake hand exactly once, Can you tell the total
count of handshakes?
Input Format
The first line contains the number of test cases T, T lines follow.
Each line then contains an integer N, the total number of Board of Directors of Acme.
Output Format
Print the number of handshakes for each test-case in a new line.
Constraints
1 <= T <= 1000
0 < N < 10
Sample Input
2
1
2
Sample Output
0
1
Explanation
Case 1 : The lonely board member shakes no hands, hence 0.
Case 2 : There are 2 board members, 1 handshake takes place.

08/02/2020, 10:33 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): And - 2^(no of bits-1) to 2^(no bits-1) -1 for signed
08/02/2020, 10:35 pm - Varun Mamtora (TSEC, CS): for int byte size req is 2 so since 1 byte =8 bits hence 2bytes=16 bits
08/02/2020, 10:35 pm - Varun Mamtora (TSEC, CS): therefore  2^(16)/2=32768

09/02/2020, 3:34 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Today's Challenge:

In C/C++ even after using the 'long long int' data type, we can compute factorial upto 20. 

Today's challenge is to write a program in C/C++ to calculate fatorial of a number 'N'

where 0 <= N <= 100

0! = 1
1! = 1
50! = 30414093201713378043612608166064768844377641568960512000000000000

12/02/2020, 8:40 pm - Saket (TSEC, CS): My tips:
1)First get firm with language.
2)Do some good implementation q's.
3)In case your code gets *tle* just try to optimize by removing unnecessary nested for loops.

It is an easier one. Then to that one
14/02/2020, 7:01 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Today's Challenge:

You are given a *sorted* array NUM of *integers* as input.

You have to generate a *sorted* array SQ of the *squares* of the *integers* of the given array.

Constraints:

1 <= length(NUM) <= 10000
-10000 <= element of NUM <= 10000

This can be done in linear time complexity.
14/02/2020, 7:03 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Please try to do this without nested for loops
14/02/2020, 7:03 pm - Mohit Varma (TSEC, CS): Means ? What shud be the output?
14/02/2020, 7:03 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): An array of squares of the numbers
14/02/2020, 7:03 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): in the given array
14/02/2020, 7:03 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): ^
14/02/2020, 7:04 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): this is out put

14/02/2020, 7:04 pm - Mohit Varma (TSEC, CS): Understood bud
14/02/2020, 7:05 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): NUM = { -2 , -1 , 0, 3, 5}
14/02/2020, 7:06 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Output:

SQ = { 0 , 1 , 4 , 9 , 25 }
14/02/2020, 7:06 pm - +91 95949 08570: Ok so first we have to find the squares
14/02/2020, 7:06 pm - +91 95949 08570: Put it in another array
14/02/2020, 7:06 pm - +91 95949 08570: Then sort it

14/02/2020, 7:07 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): can be done using  better logic
14/02/2020, 7:07 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): only 1 for loop
14/02/2020, 7:07 pm - Mohit Varma (TSEC, CS): Kinda ascending? Descending?
14/02/2020, 7:07 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): see example
14/02/2020, 7:08 pm - +91 95949 08570: Yes
14/02/2020, 7:08 pm - +91 96536 93868: for sorting we need nested loop but the question can be solved without it .....
14/02/2020, 7:08 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): exactly
14/02/2020, 7:08 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): @919594908570 
I had implemented a similar program in Java with Strings.
I have tested it with numbers upto 1000.

19/02/2020, 10:21 pm - +91 70394 60876: Sussutu is a world-renowned magician. And recently, he was blessed with the power to remove EXACTLY ONE element from an array.

Given, an array A (index starting from 0) with N elements. Now, Sussutu CAN remove only that element which makes the sum of ALL the remaining elements exactly divisible by 7.

Throughout his life, Sussutu was so busy with magic that he could never get along with maths. Your task is to help Sussutu find the first array index of the smallest element he CAN remove.

 

*Input:*

The first line contains a single integer N.

Next line contains N space separated integers Ak , 0 < k < N.

 

*Output:*

Print a single line containing one integer, the first array index of the smallest element he CAN remove, and -1 if there is no such element that he can remove!

 

*Constraints:*

1 < N < 105

0 < Ak < 109

From the array if you remove one element, the sum of the rest of the elements become divisible by 7.
In case of multiple such elements find the smallest one

21/02/2020, 12:41 am - Tushar Nankani: Sussutu is a world-renowned magician. And recently, he was blessed with the power to remove EXACTLY ONE element from an array.

Given, an array A (index starting from 0) with N elements. Now, Sussutu CAN remove only that element which makes the sum of ALL the remaining elements exactly divisible by 7.

Throughout his life, Sussutu was so busy with magic that he could never get along with maths. Your task is to help Sussutu find the first array index of the smallest element he CAN remove.

 

*Input:*

The first line contains a single integer N.

Next line contains N space separated integers Ak , 0 < k < N.

 

*Output:*

Print a single line containing one integer, the first array index of the smallest element he CAN remove, and -1 if there is no such element that he can remove!

 

*Constraints:*

1 < N < 105

0 < Ak < 109
21/02/2020, 12:42 am - Tushar Nankani: Take a string as an input from the user.
Make a new string of length 18 characters, containing random characters and the new string should also contain each and every letter of the input string(also distributed randomly).
Example
Input:
Controller
Output:

}
22/02/2020, 12:57 am - Farhan Irani (TSEC IT, SE): make one loop to print the number of spaces,     and  another one the print the values acc to the number of rows. eg row 2 will have 2 values. and increment value every time you print it
22/02/2020, 12:58 am - Farhan Irani (TSEC IT, SE): and for the main for loop,at the end , the spaces will be decremented by 1 , because its moving to the left
22/02/2020, 1:01 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): #include<stdio.h>

void main()
{
  int r, s, sp, data, n;
  
  printf("Please enter number of rows: ");
  scanf("%d", &n);
  data = 1;
  for(sp = 20, r = 1 ; r <= 5 ;r++,sp--)
  {
    for(s = 1 ; s <= sp ; s++)
    {
        printf("   ");
    }

    for(s = 1; s <= r; s++)
    {
      printf("%3d", data);
      data = data + 1;
    }

22/02/2020, 10:05 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): You will be ranked on the basis of the score you get.
In case of a tie, the rankings will be determined by 'Total Penalty', which is the sum of the total time elapsed when you submitted the correct submission plus a penalty of 'X' minutes for every rejected submission (Wrong answer, Time limit exceeded, Runtime Error) for a problem you solved. The lower you Total Penalty, the better.
The total time is the time taken to solve a problem since the start of the contest.
Getting Compilation Error does not contribute towards the 'X' minutes penalty.
The time elapsed or penalty is not considered for any unsolved problem.

22/02/2020, 11:01 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Also, 
Many of us are  used to coding in an IDE or Text editor 
the environment of Hackerrank/Codechef/Codeforces is very different 
So a little into to that will be great
Like, most of the times, our solution is correct but because we did not print output in the way they wanted, it shows an error
22/02/2020, 11:04 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): Yes that'll be covered , dw
22/02/2020, 11:17 pm - Saurav Upoor (TSEC CS, SE): i find coding in text editor easier than hackerrank or other site Ide...u just upload the local file while submitting
22/02/2020, 11:18 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Ya, but you gotta see how they take input and out put na
Consider testcases
make for loops and all
22/02/2020, 11:19 pm - Saurav Upoor (TSEC CS, SE): so that can be done in text editors too right..?
22/02/2020, 11:20 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): yes
22/02/2020, 11:20 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): But the problem is I can't analyse how they want input some times

01/03/2020, 10:57 am - Saurav Upoor (TSEC CS, SE): Instructions for the mashup:
You will be ranked on the basis of the score you get.
In case of a tie, the rankings will be determined by 'Total Penalty', which is the sum of the total time elapsed when you submitted the correct submission plus a penalty of 'X' minutes for every rejected submission (Wrong answer, Time limit exceeded, Runtime Error) for a problem you solved. The lower your Total Penalty, the better.
The total time is the time taken to solve a problem since the start of the contest.
Getting Compilation Error does not contribute towards the 'X' minutes penalty.
The time elapsed or penalty is not considered for any unsolved problem.Good luck!

01/03/2020, 11:02 am - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): Register before contest starts or else you won't be able to enter.
01/03/2020, 11:02 am - +91 79770 56210: Where can we find the conventions which we have to follow like using int main return 0 instead of void main
01/03/2020, 11:03 am - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): use int main return 0
01/03/2020, 11:03 am - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): instead of void main
01/03/2020, 11:03 am - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): for some weird reason this doesn't work
01/03/2020, 11:04 am - +91 79770 56210: But r there any other things that we need to know like this one
01/03/2020, 11:04 am - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): No, nothing else
01/03/2020, 11:04 am - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): .
01/03/2020, 11:04 am - +91 79770 56210: Ok
01/03/2020, 11:04 am - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): when you use void main program keeps on running?
01/03/2020, 11:05 am - +91 79770 56210: It runs in the ide but when i submit it it gives runtime error
01/03/2020, 11:08 am - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): i guess CodeForces's compiler expects a return value 0 to be returned from every program. If 0 is returned, it means program has been executed successfully. If anything other than that means something is wrong with the code.
01/03/2020, 11:09 am - +91 79770 56210: Ohk
01/03/2020, 11:09 am - +91 99693 94098: void main never worked with C89 or C99 anyway

03/03/2020, 10:30 pm - Saurav Upoor (TSEC CS, SE): If a[i] % m = a[j] % m for some i < j, then answer is 0. Otherwise there are <= m numbers, so you can calculate answer in O(N^2).

Integer.parseInt(in.readLine()); //for integer
in.readLine() //for String```

05/03/2020, 1:59 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): This message was deleted
05/03/2020, 2:00 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Because they have several disadvantages as well.
For example, in C++,
```cin.tie(NULL)``` means that you can input data while the program is printing to the screen.
```ios::sync_with_stdio(false)``` does not sync ```cout``` with ```printf```.

08/03/2020, 1:59 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): You will be ranked on the basis of the score you get.
In case of a tie, the rankings will be determined by 'Total Penalty', which is the sum of the total time elapsed when you submitted the correct submission plus a penalty of 'X' minutes for every rejected submission (Wrong answer, Time limit exceeded, Runtime Error) for a problem you solved. The lower your Total Penalty, the better.
The total time is the time taken to solve a problem since the start of the contest.
Getting Compilation Error does not contribute towards the 'X' minutes penalty.
The time elapsed or penalty is not considered for any unsolved problem.Good luck!

15/03/2020, 11:48 am - Saurav Upoor (TSEC CS, SE): You will be ranked on the basis of the score you get.
In case of a tie, the rankings will be determined by 'Total Penalty', which is the sum of the total time elapsed when you submitted the correct submission plus a penalty of 'X' minutes for every rejected submission (Wrong answer, Time limit exceeded, Runtime Error) for a problem you solved. The lower your Total Penalty, the better.
The total time is the time taken to solve a problem since the start of the contest.
Getting Compilation Error does not contribute towards the 'X' minutes penalty.
The time elapsed or penalty is not considered for any unsolved problem.Good luck!

15/03/2020, 11:58 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Example 2: This shows the creation and import of user-defined file.

Creating a user-defined header by the name of ‚Äúprocess.h‚Äù.
// It is not recommended to put function definitions 
// in a header file. Ideally there should be only 
// function declarations. Purpose of this code is 
// to only demonstrate working of header files. 

  

void add(int a, int b) 
{ 

    printf("Added value=%d\n", a + b); 
} 

  

void multiply(int a, int b) 
{ 

    printf("Multiplied value=%d\n", a * b); 
} 
Created the main file where the above ‚Äúprocess.h‚Äù will be included.
// C program to illustrate file inclusion 
// <> used to import system header file 
#include <stdio.h> 

  
// " " used to import user-defined file 
#include "process.h" 

  
// main function 

int main() 
{ 

    // add function defined in process.h 

    add(10, 20); 

  

    // mult function defined in process.h 

    mult(10, 20); 

  

    // printf defined in stdio.h 

    printf("Process completed"); 

    return 0;

17/03/2020, 1:16 pm - +91 73043 57388: Competitive programming websites 
1. hackerRank
2. HackerEarth
3. Codechef
4. Codeforces

Please start practicing on hackerRank and HackerEarth first
Get comfortable with it and then on codechef and codeforces

Otherwise problems on codechef and codeforces are enough to make u feel demotivated .
Although there certain programmers specially like Abdullah Aslam 7 Star coder on codechef who directly started with codechef but i don't recommend that follow a straight and simple way and progress gradually.
17/03/2020, 1:16 pm - +91 73043 57388: Ok everyone so let's start
Road to CP
1. First thing u have to do is to make a firm and strong decision whether u really wanna do CP or not.
Reason why I am telling u this is because many people just do it because their classmates are doing CP and they appear to be alien in that field which is not the correct reason to do something.
Let me tell u one thing very honestly if u want job in product based companies of Software development engineer position u need to have good problem solving skills at any cost whatsoever and excellent knowledge of Data Structures and Algorithms.
If u are doing CP like I opened my laptop today and I am opening it after 20 days it's not gonna work like that way if ur serious about CP then u have to chalk a good week plan be consistent and steadfast in it.
Sometimes it may happen that u become demotivated and left CP for a month or so BUT it should happen only sometimes and u should try to come back as soon as possible
2. How to start , learn only C++ and do CP only in C++. C++ is the best language for CP.
3. For those who don't want to go for any course(which I don't recommend)
Check out this video

This video is by karan Gujar from Thakur college of Engineering

I know him personally.
We were preparing for IIT together in RIIT classes
Now he is a 6th star coder on codechef 
Follow each and every point he told in the video.

Also follow him on quora for various answers and medium for his blog posts and tutorials.

This is one of the most common questions about which students remain confused 
"How to manage projects development and CP?"
Check out Rachit jain answer
17/03/2020, 1:16 pm - +91 73043 57388: One Important thing u have to insure that will doing CP ur growth and problem solving should increase exponentially.
17/03/2020, 1:16 pm - +91 73043 57388: Please make sure u watch this video only after u have started with C++ and covered a large topics on it 
Otherwise trees linked list all this things might become confusing for u.

But if ur in Second year ofcourse DSA has been covered in college so u should try to get comfortable with c++ within 2-3 weeks if u dont know c++ and then u can follow that with DSA
17/03/2020, 1:17 pm - +91 73043 57388: For FE students:
In college C language is covered by now,right? So learning c++ will be very easy BUT before properly learning c++ fundementals such as loops,arrays, strings, recursion, dynamic memory allocation etc and practicing questions on these topics 
Don't dare to jump on DSA.
For Second year:
Ur now stepping in third after a few months so u should better take a placement course because if u delay now things will become overwhelming because u have to Also focus on projects and when it comes to placement along with problem solving skills they will check ur knowledge of Object oriented programming, Database management, Operating System, computer networks. Many people will tell u that u don't need to take any placement course right now there is much time for campus placement but according to my experience it's better if u take a course and start preparing right away from placement point of u because till next year u can become not only a good programmer but also u will be prepared thoroughly for Campus interviews.
What u need to know about placements is that cracking interviews and CP are different things in interviews they don't expect or even bother whether ur a super competitive programmer or a 1 star programmer(although mentioning hackerRank Ranks, codechef ratings will ofcourse give golden layer to ur resume) But what they expect from u is u should be able to solve the interview problems with optimised solutions and try to think even if ur not able to solve the problem.

Companies do see ur Website profile specially hackerRank while if u Solve practice contest questions on codechef ur rating is not gonna increase as far as I know ratings codechef increases only when we participate and solve in long challenge, lunchtime and cookoff.
Rest as u wish practicing is important anyway

You never explicitly call the constructor.
When you create a new obj of a class, you invoke the constructor of that class implicitly.

18/03/2020, 12:10 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Yeah
18/03/2020, 12:32 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): OK, yes, this is instantiation of an object, but how is this an implicit call?

You, the programmer, is explicitly writing ```new Object()```.

If this is an implicit call, then can you please give an example of an explicit call.
18/03/2020, 12:36 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Did you read the article?

I think that it is about constructor overloading using ```this```.
18/03/2020, 7:01 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): https://youtu.be/0CDKwzf0JxM
18/03/2020, 7:09 pm - +91 97739 65140: Ok so this is how I have learnt it.
In Java if you write Obj object, it implicitly and in your class if there is no constructor,then javac automatically puts a non-paratmeterized constructor in your class
Hence, implicit call
*But* ,if you define a constructor in your class ,it is you who explicitly define it and hence that constructor will be used by javac in your program for object instantiation.
18/03/2020, 7:10 pm - +91 97739 65140: The second case will be explicit creation
18/03/2020, 7:10 pm - +91 97739 65140: *call
18/03/2020, 7:26 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): You are mixing the default (implicit) constructor *definition* with implicit *calling*.
18/03/2020, 7:26 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Yeah
18/03/2020, 7:28 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): When you define a class and do not provide a constructor, Java implicitly defines the default constructor.

But when you declare an object as ```Object obj```, *no constructor is called* and ```obj = null```.
18/03/2020, 7:28 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): This is unlike C++, where the non parameterized constructor is called implicitly.

for(i=0;i>=0;i++)
printf("%d",i);
Though this is an infinite loop,but it should break at some point due to Integer overflow right?

21/03/2020, 1:18 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): You will be ranked on the basis of the score you get.
In case of a tie, the rankings will be determined by 'Total Penalty', which is the sum of the total time elapsed when you submitted the correct submission plus a penalty of 'X' minutes for every rejected submission (Wrong answer, Time limit exceeded, Runtime Error) for a problem you solved. The lower your Total Penalty, the better.
The total time is the time taken to solve a problem since the start of the contest.
Getting Compilation Error does not contribute towards the 'X' minutes penalty.
The time elapsed or penalty is not considered for any unsolved problem.
Good luck!

21/03/2020, 5:03 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): You will be ranked on the basis of the score you get.
In case of a tie, the rankings will be determined by 'Total Penalty', which is the sum of the total time elapsed when you submitted the correct submission plus a penalty of 'X' minutes for every rejected submission (Wrong answer, Time limit exceeded, Runtime Error) for a problem you solved. The lower your Total Penalty, the better.
The total time is the time taken to solve a problem since the start of the contest.
Getting Compilation Error does not contribute towards the 'X' minutes penalty.
The time elapsed or penalty is not considered for any unsolved problem.
Good luck!

23/03/2020, 10:20 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Steve has a string of lowercase characters in range ascii[‚Äòa‚Äô..‚Äôz‚Äô]. He wants to reduce the string to its shortest length by doing a series of operations. In each operation he selects a pair of adjacent lowercase letters that match, and he deletes them. For instance, the string aab could be shortened to b in one operation.

Steve‚Äôs task is to delete as many characters as possible using this method and print the resulting string. If the final string is empty, print Empty String

Function Description

Internet services have become slow & there can be a complete breakdown, so lets not fwd VIDEOS ...

There is limited bandwidth only. It‚Äôs being heavily guzzled by OTTs steaming videos- Amazon/ hot star / Netflix. 

Critical services  need to be prioritised.

 Internet providers are having a tough time keeping the telco facilities on with all sorts of lock down and mass apathy and no staff. 

So please only use and watch what‚Äôs necessary and switch to non HD streaming

 üôè. And don‚Äôt forward non essential videos.

Else full shut down is not far. If they shut down

26/03/2020, 12:06 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): In today's world, basic programming skills are extremely advantageous in a tech driven world. You can use it to customise games, build your own websites and do things that you can't already do with your computer. As a computer engineering student I have done this before for first year engineering students and 8th grade students. During this time of curfew, I feel I should introduce even more people to this amazing skill.

The workshop shall be conducted online, as either a call or youtube live.

The workshop shall be completely free of charge. 

Kindly register here if interested, and we'll decide on a time and date suitable for all

30/03/2020, 8:19 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): i had found this soln online it was good
30/03/2020, 8:20 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): This makes it much easier
30/03/2020, 8:58 pm - Saket (TSEC, CS): Ig upper_bound will make it much simpler
30/03/2020, 9:11 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): No, upper bound returns an iterator to the value just greater than X. 

Lower bound returns an iterator to the value NOT LESS THAN 'X'. Means lower bound will return an iterator to the value if value is present the array . While upper bound will return an iterator to the element which is strictly greater than the value. If value is not present in the array it will return an iterator pointing to position just after vector_name.end().While lower bound will return an iterator pointing to the value.
30/03/2020, 9:14 pm - +91 88305 26885: Then in this we might have to implement binary search
30/03/2020, 9:14 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): Lower bound internally binary search hi hai

31/03/2020, 12:06 pm - Saurav Upoor (TSEC CS, SE): I embarked on my journey of learning and discovering  ML in the first year of Engineering, ever since each day is about figuring out fascinating developments in ML üìä
However this journey would not be easy if it weren't for the support of my seniors,mentors and the exposures I got being a part of committees in college.
Few days ago when people approached me for organizing an *ML workshop*, I thought there was no better way to reciprocate the support and push I had received myself when I started some years back.
So I will be organising a workshop on ML:

*Where:* Online

*Time:* next week, time suitable to all

*Cost*: üÜì

Lets make the most of the time, that we have in abundance due to lockdown, to discover and gain a basic idea as to what ML is!
*Those interested please fill out the form:*  https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfRAs17JL2S7Ynm5LdHXLEmkzZ2mIONcXPgGSaKdwKJNDXjBA/viewform?usp=sf_link

31/03/2020, 3:36 pm - Tushar Nankani: This ML Workshop would be directed in a way to introduce all interested to the world of ML (it is kinda impossible to teach everything in a workshop, but its a good idea to get started on it.)
31/03/2020, 3:37 pm - Tushar Nankani: The workshop would consist of the following topics:
Numpy and Pandas
Data Preprocessing(using Numpy and Pandas)
Supervised Learning
Unsupervised Learning
Deep Learning and Transfer Learning
31/03/2020, 3:39 pm - Tushar Nankani: The above three are branches of ML. A proper introduction would be given, along with one or two models in it for understanding. Though there will be a prerequisite of python, but he'll be going through the basics at the start.
He will try to explain a few projects, share the code for us to understand.

03/04/2020, 10:06 pm - +91 88305 26885: Iterate over the array and check whether we have a permutation upto this index
03/04/2020, 10:06 pm - Saurav Upoor (TSEC CS, SE): ohhh okay
03/04/2020, 10:07 pm - +91 88305 26885: U had any other thoughts?
03/04/2020, 10:08 pm - Saurav Upoor (TSEC CS, SE): i was thinking about iterative only between pos of 1s
03/04/2020, 10:09 pm - Saurav Upoor (TSEC CS, SE): didnt consider the fact that 0 answer was possible too
03/04/2020, 10:10 pm - +91 88305 26885: What was ur approach for checking permutation?
03/04/2020, 10:10 pm - Saurav Upoor (TSEC CS, SE): what was ur tc?
03/04/2020, 10:10 pm - Saurav Upoor (TSEC CS, SE): used set
03/04/2020, 10:10 pm - +91 88305 26885: Oh and then check is size equal to max element and all
03/04/2020, 10:11 pm - Saurav Upoor (TSEC CS, SE): hmm wouldnt work for l2 though
03/04/2020, 10:12 pm - +91 88305 26885: My code took 342ms others had 42ms also
03/04/2020, 10:13 pm - Saurav Upoor (TSEC CS, SE): ohhh
03/04/2020, 10:13 pm - Saurav Upoor (TSEC CS, SE): how did u check permutation?
03/04/2020, 10:14 pm - +91 88305 26885: Inserted in the set maintained two variables for min and Max and then checked whether size is equal to max or not and  min =1
03/04/2020, 10:15 pm - Saurav Upoor (TSEC CS, SE): nice i had thought about it but didnt think that would've been efficient xP
03/04/2020, 10:15 pm - +91 88305 26885: Hmm
04/04/2020, 5:15 pm - +91 77385 57601: Kl hai codeforces?

04/04/2020, 9:58 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Can anyone explain the difference between the following in java?
ArrayList<String> fruits=new ArrayList ();
List<String> fruits = new ArrayList();
04/04/2020, 9:59 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Also can any1 explain the meaning of the second statement in this?

04/04/2020, 10:33 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Technically, both your statements are wrong:
```ArrayList<String> fruits = new ArrayList<>();
List<String> fruits = new ArrayList<>();```

04/04/2020, 10:35 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): In 1st statement, variable ```fruits``` is an ArrayList, and in second statement, it is of type List.
List is an abstract class, so it cannot be instantiated directly.
List is used to group several different implementations of Lists, like ArrayList, LinkedList, etc.
04/04/2020, 10:37 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Both statements have almost identical functionality, the only difference is that if you want to change the implementation for any reason, you will have to update all the code.
The second statement allows you to hide the actual list implementation.
05/04/2020, 12:13 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Ty
05/04/2020, 12:13 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): It gives a warning
05/04/2020, 12:14 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): List is an interface iy
05/04/2020, 12:14 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Ig
05/04/2020, 12:17 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): No: ```error: List is abstract; cannot be instantiated```.
05/04/2020, 12:17 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): I mean both are not type safe.
05/04/2020, 12:17 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Yeah
05/04/2020, 12:18 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Gives issues
05/04/2020, 12:19 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Collection is an interface and List extends Collection and itself is an interface as well
05/04/2020, 12:19 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Then ArrayList,LinkedList etc are classes in List
05/04/2020, 12:23 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): You learn something every day.
05/04/2020, 12:23 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): ```public interface List<E> extends Collection<E>```
05/04/2020, 12:24 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): (From the source code)
05/04/2020, 12:24 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): But did you understand the difference?
05/04/2020, 12:27 am - Tushar Nankani: üôåüèª
05/04/2020, 12:27 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): I am learning Java from Apni kaksha(Aman Dhattarwal's channel)
05/04/2020, 12:28 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): ü§î why is there a generic at the end
05/04/2020, 12:28 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Because Collection is also generic.
05/04/2020, 12:28 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Ohk

05/04/2020, 5:17 pm - +91 97681 67131: Given a string of digits S, insert a minimum number of opening and closing parentheses into it such that the resulting string is balanced and each digit d is inside exactly d pairs of matching parentheses.
Let the nesting of two parentheses within a string be the substring that occurs strictly between them. An opening parenthesis and a closing parenthesis that is further to its right are said to match if their nesting is empty, or if every parenthesis in their nesting matches with another parenthesis in their nesting. The nesting depth of a position p is the number of pairs of matching parentheses m such that p is included in the nesting of m.
For example, in the following strings, all digits match their nesting depth: 0((2)1), (((3))1(2)), ((((4)))), ((2))((2))(1). The first three strings have minimum length among those that have the same digits in the same order, but the last one does not since ((22)1) also has the digits 221 and is shorter.
Given a string of digits S, find another string S', comprised of parentheses and digits, such that:
all parentheses in S' match some other parenthesis,
removing any and all parentheses from S' results in S,
each digit in S' is equal to its nesting depth, and
S' is of minimum length.
Input
The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, T. T lines follow. Each line represents a test case and contains only the string S.
Output
For each test case, output one line containing Case #x: y, where x is the test case number (starting from 1) and y is the string S' defined above.
Limits
Time limit: 20 seconds per test set.
Memory limit: 1GB.
1 ‚â§ T ‚â§ 100.
1 ‚â§ length of S ‚â§ 100.
Test set 1 (Visible Verdict)
Each character in S is either 0 or 1.
Test set 2 (Visible Verdict)
Each character in S is a decimal digit between 0 and 9, inclusive.
Sample

Input   
 
4
0000
101
111000
1

Output 
Case #1: 0000
Case #2: (1)0(1)
Case #3: (111)000
Case #4: (1)

  
The strings ()0000(), (1)0(((()))1) and (1)(11)000 are not valid solutions to Sample Cases #1, #2 and #3, respectively, only because they are not of minimum length. In addition, 1)( and )(1 are not valid solutions to Sample Case #4 because they contain unmatched parentheses and the nesting depth is 0 at the position where there is a 1.
You can create sample inputs that are valid only for Test Set 2 by removing the parentheses from the example strings mentioned in the problem statement.

Just a counter and an empty string's enough

07/04/2020, 1:59 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): But when is it required then
07/04/2020, 1:59 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): I mean its a non-primitive data type right?
07/04/2020, 2:11 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): (String) al.get(0); is explicit typecasting.
It is only required when your code is not typesafe.

If you make a generic (Object) ArrayList as: ```List al = new ArrayList();```, then you will need to typecast the objects while using get.
07/04/2020, 2:12 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): That is the reason why it is always encouraged to have a datatype in the ArrayList.
07/04/2020, 2:15 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Side note: If you have a generic ArrayList, then code like this will work.
```List al = new ArrayList();
al.add("Abcd");
al.add(10);
al.add(true);```
07/04/2020, 2:27 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Yeah tyüëç

11/04/2020, 8:39 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): @917506412914 @918080142783
11/04/2020, 8:42 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): If you work in an organisation and you need to follow a certain structure, an interface can be used to have uniformity of structure, but difference of implementations.

Interfaces help to maintain uniformity and consistency.
11/04/2020, 8:42 pm - +91 73043 57388: Interfaces are used when objects have common properties

For example
Students common properties are
Nane roll no DOB
Etc 
So student class can be parent class
And student can be of engineering , medical, pharmacy etc
So these branches becomes child classes
11/04/2020, 8:48 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Abstract classes can be used when you want to enforce only certain functions in that class and leave a choice for the other functions to be used or not.

The function signatures without the ```abstract``` keyword in the abstract class do not need to be implemented compulsorily in the class extending the abstract class, but they need to.have an implementation in the abstract class. Their implementation cannot be changed or defined in the class extending the abstract class like the abstract fns
11/04/2020, 8:52 pm - +91 73043 57388: Oh sorry this is Inheritance explanation ü§¶
11/04/2020, 8:53 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Yeah
11/04/2020, 9:01 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Usually, interfaces are used to provide INDEPENDENT functionality. Like the ```Iterator``` interface allows objects to be iterated over, and the ```Runnable``` interface allows processes to run in a separate thread. You can have a class that is both iterable, and can run in a separate thread.
Interfaces are for things that applicable to a broad range of objects different objects.

Classes provide MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE functionality. Like, if you have a ```Stack`` class and a ```Queue``` class. There is no point in creating a ``StackQueue``` class.
11/04/2020, 9:04 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Yeah makes sense
Thank you
11/04/2020, 9:04 pm - +91 97681 67131: So a superclass can inherit multiple such interfaces whereas it can only inherit one abstract class right?
11/04/2020, 9:07 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Yes
11/04/2020, 9:07 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): The PARENT class is called superclass.
Child classes are called subclasses.

In Java, one (sub)class can only inherit from one superclass, and multiple interfaces.

Note: C++ allows multiple inheritance.
11/04/2020, 9:08 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): A child class*

12/04/2020, 4:43 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): java too sucks,dunno why my code gives run time errors on codeforces
12/04/2020, 4:44 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): but works fine on ide
12/04/2020, 4:44 pm - Saurav Upoor (TSEC CS, SE): sc.nextLine might be one of the reason?
12/04/2020, 4:44 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): ?
12/04/2020, 4:44 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): I have taken a dummy variable

12/04/2020, 4:45 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): this happens many times dk why
12/04/2020, 4:46 pm - Saurav Upoor (TSEC CS, SE): Dont you check other users' Java submissions? Like in every mashup there's someone with the same problem
12/04/2020, 4:46 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): will check
12/04/2020, 4:46 pm - Saurav Upoor (TSEC CS, SE): üëç

12/04/2020, 5:19 pm - Saurav Upoor (TSEC CS, SE): checking connected components ig
12/04/2020, 5:19 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Any1 else using java?
12/04/2020, 5:20 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Both my problems were working fine on IDEüòì
12/04/2020, 5:27 pm - Tushar Nankani: Graphs.
12/04/2020, 5:27 pm - Tushar Nankani: Problem E is üôåüèªü§Ø
12/04/2020, 5:28 pm - +91 88305 26885: i knew but specifically it was about connected components as saurav said
12/04/2020, 5:29 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Is String args[] compulsory?
12/04/2020, 5:30 pm - +91 82916 21138: Depends on ide but most of them it is
12/04/2020, 5:30 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): I didn't include it any of my codesüòÖ
12/04/2020, 5:30 pm - +91 88305 26885: @918408867834 it was a directed graph right is the algorithm same for both graphs ?
12/04/2020, 5:30 pm - Saurav Upoor (TSEC CS, SE): Nope
12/04/2020, 5:30 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Bluej mai it isn't
12/04/2020, 5:30 pm - +91 82916 21138: Ya it isn't
12/04/2020, 5:30 pm - +91 82916 21138: For first question what approaches did you all use
12/04/2020, 5:30 pm - Saurav Upoor (TSEC CS, SE): For directed graphs we check for Strongly connected components using Kosarajus algo
12/04/2020, 5:30 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Codeforces mai it is ig,thats why run time error aa rha hai
12/04/2020, 5:31 pm - +91 82916 21138: I used doubly ended queue
12/04/2020, 5:31 pm - Saurav Upoor (TSEC CS, SE): After finding SCC we get condensed graph and now in this condensed graph we can count nodes with indeg 0
12/04/2020, 5:32 pm - +91 88305 26885: Ig that's over my headüòÖ

12/04/2020, 5:32 pm - +91 88305 26885: K thanks
12/04/2020, 5:32 pm - Saurav Upoor (TSEC CS, SE): There was one question in recent rds too that used this
12/04/2020, 5:33 pm - Saurav Upoor (TSEC CS, SE): Last Mashup F problem
12/04/2020, 5:39 pm - +91 88305 26885: Ik only DFS and bfs what's the next imp graph algo
12/04/2020, 5:41 pm - Saurav Upoor (TSEC CS, SE): abhi k liye thats enough...currently in graphs im studying their basic applications. while upsolving i came across the above algo...

12/04/2020, 6:36 pm - +91 97681 67131: got any alternatives?
12/04/2020, 6:40 pm - Tushar Nankani: ```import string
 
n,k=map(int,input().split())
s=list(input())
 
for char in string.ascii_lowercase:
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if k == 0:

        elif s[i]==char:
            s[i]=''
            k-=1
 
print(''.join(s))```
12/04/2020, 6:41 pm - Tushar Nankani: suggestion: string.ascii_lowercase can be directly used for lower case alphabets.
12/04/2020, 6:41 pm - +91 97681 67131: why is this faster ?
12/04/2020, 6:42 pm - +91 97681 67131: could u submit ans and was it accepted?
12/04/2020, 6:42 pm - Tushar Nankani: Yes. It was accepted.

12/04/2020, 6:44 pm - +91 97681 67131: any idea why urs works faster?
12/04/2020, 6:45 pm - +91 97681 67131: are while loops slower than for loops?
12/04/2020, 6:45 pm - +91 97681 67131: or is slicing the problem?
12/04/2020, 6:45 pm - +91 97681 67131: if anyone knows pls tell
12/04/2020, 6:47 pm - Tushar Nankani: I think nested loops increases time a lot more in python. Initially, I used while and for; which gave me TLE.
12/04/2020, 6:48 pm - Tushar Nankani: Therefore, alternative would be by taking that counter ```k```, avoiding the while loop.
12/04/2020, 6:48 pm - Tushar Nankani: I don't think so^
12/04/2020, 6:49 pm - Tushar Nankani: I am not sure about this though.

12/04/2020, 6:53 pm - Rishab Saini (TSEC CS, TE): Technically yeah
12/04/2020, 6:54 pm - Rishab Saini (TSEC CS, TE): Range works much faster

12/04/2020, 6:55 pm - Rishab Saini (TSEC CS, TE): complexities of inbuilt functions in python
12/04/2020, 6:56 pm - +91 97681 67131: ya i also read that too but i think strings faster when we use them for concatination i think working with lists also helped his soln
12/04/2020, 7:17 pm - +91 77150 51136: Maybe you can use replace
12/04/2020, 7:43 pm - +91 97681 67131: replace will remove all occurences of given character from string so i think will not work
12/04/2020, 7:47 pm - +91 77150 51136: It also has count parameter
12/04/2020, 7:47 pm - +91 77150 51136: You can use that
12/04/2020, 7:48 pm - +91 97681 67131: ya wait let me try if it accepts that
12/04/2020, 7:49 pm - +91 77150 51136: üëçüèª
12/04/2020, 8:10 pm - +91 97681 67131: There are three things increasing time complexity i think upon trying to run various versions in time it :
12/04/2020, 8:12 pm - +91 97681 67131: 1) s.count(char) != 0: instead just in operator works for checking
2) using lists therefore inturn using ranges for them as @919820487592 said they are more efficient and also thus while loop causing more time

15/04/2020, 12:43 pm - +91 73043 57388: Hello everyone there is one important thing which I learned just now that one of the person whom I reffered to follow on Quora for CP has caught for cheating in codeJam Round 1A and that is Karan Gujar 
Because I didn't knew about previous allegations on him and even now it's not 100% sure whether or not he has done it( but it seems most probably that he really cheated that's because he has deleted all his social media handles) so I suggested him.
It's very unfortunate thing that has happened and I my advice my fellow programming aspirants don't rush behind ratings, stars red coder etc focus on becoming a good programmer each day and try to learn new things all this ratings stars etc will come with time but u should not be ready to compromise ur ethics and values just for the sake of Show off and publicity because its not going to help in the long run.

18/04/2020, 10:11 pm - +91 73043 57388: ?

18/04/2020, 10:19 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): No need of recursion
18/04/2020, 10:21 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): If there is an even element in array there is an answer consisting of only it. Otherwise if there is at least two odd elements in array there is an answer consisting of this two elements. Otherwise array is only one odd element and there is no answer.

18/04/2020, 11:12 pm - +91 73043 57388: The problems on finding subsets are usually called combination of numbers problem 
For finding subsets u simply combine the concept of iteration and recursion 

For that u have to create 2 arrays one will be having all given numbers
Second array will be temporary array which is going to hold every possible subset by taking each number of the given array one by one

So suppose u have 
Given array 1 2 3 4
And u wan to find all possible subsets

We use a for loop for traversing through the given loop

For(i=0;i<n;i++)
{ 
   temp[0]=arr[i];
   Recursion_func
}

We draw a recursion tree for that
18/04/2020, 11:13 pm - +91 73043 57388: Explaination of recursion function I will give u tomorrow if u don't mind

25/04/2020, 12:10 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Difficult choice between Python and Kotlin.
25/04/2020, 12:24 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Why tho?
25/04/2020, 12:25 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Python gone means a lot of stuff from this field gone and Kotlin gone means bye-bye android applications
25/04/2020, 12:48 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): No, just the LANGUAGE, not the all the programs. I just don't like Python's syntax.
98% of android apps are written in Java even today. Kotlin was supposed to reduce the boilerplate needed for Java.
But, in Kotlin, you have to type ```val a: int;```. In Java, it is ```int a;``` now which one is shorter?
25/04/2020, 12:49 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Kotlin is now official Android language ig
25/04/2020, 1:09 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Yes, unfortunately. But most of the Android api's are still in Java, and even today, you cannot make an Android app without using at least some Java.
25/04/2020, 1:09 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): But both languages are JVM compatible, so I will stick to Java, at least for now.
25/04/2020, 1:13 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): üëç
25/04/2020, 1:13 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Yeah

30/04/2020, 5:32 pm - +91 99693 94098: Hey everyone,
I would like to share with you something that I have been working with for almost 2 months now. In search for efficient medical imaging and diagnosis methods for COVID-19, I worked with radiologists at arterys.com to come up with AI based solutions for faster diagnostic methods. The challenge was to recognise early symptoms of the virus on PA Chest X-rays (since CT scans aren't always available) taken from varying hospitals across the US, China and Italy.
After extensive research with pretrained and custom models, an ensembled version of both worked well for my case of Opacity detection. This will act as a first stage diagnosis for upcoming pneumonia-like symptoms in patients. The patient will be then advised to get a PCR test done for final confirmation, thereby saving testing kits and securing lives of radiologists who might come in contact with the virus
Today I am sharing my repository with all of you to help spread the message about it. I would also like to mention that these results might lead to a few extra false positives due to the reduced threshold but active work is being put in to reduce these errors. The repo consists of a sample keras implementation of the best custom and Resnet models. Also note that training these keras models in the notebook might give different results than the included models because of the custom training loops and pruning methods applied during the original training.

02/05/2020, 4:50 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Good work!

My suggestions:
- Tell the user that a left swipe on a note will delete it (add a small line of text at the head)
- On the profile page at the bottom, add your name in the fol. format: 'Made with ‚ù§Ô∏è by Gaurav Raj' (with Gaurav Raj being a hyperlink to your social media. Your project is open source, so add a link to your repo for contributions...)
- Further features: 
-- Notifications / reminders (take both time & date)
-- Add a choice to input some description as well.

Just my opinions and suggestions, you're free to do as you want to!

Awesome work on the app. Keep building and preferably keep building up on one or two project(s) rather than making too many projects.

Keep going!

I am not really good at Development but
 --> Some small suggestions from my side.
- When we re-edit the note, try changing the date and time, as "last edited". 
- When we tap on the picture to change the profile, it opens up the camera directly. Maybe try adding another option, asking access for the gallery, so as to select the image from the gallery. 

Looks amazing! Keep it up! ^_^

03/05/2020, 7:59 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): Codeforces Round #639: the round is rescheduled.

Hello, Codeforces!

Unfortunately, I report that I decided to reschedule this round. I'm afraid that something might go wrong. Some strange database behavior has appeared, which leads to slow operation in completely unexpected places (it never was and should not be). I will work hard to fix it. My recent tests show that this can dramatically increase judging time (and leads to a huge queue). I don't want to risk the efforts of the writer, the coordinator, testers, and your time. Sorry about it, I was trying to fix it for many hours but I need more time. Hope it will be a great round!

Mike.

UPD: I temporarily rescheduled it on May, 6. But I'll discuss the date with the writer and coordinator and reschedule it again to the date they want.

03/05/2020, 9:16 pm - Tushar Nankani: *Sort 10 billion numbers*

10 billion numbers are given, sort them


*Approach 1 :-  (External Sorting)*
Here k is the size of maximum elements which  can be sorted internally.
Since the size of numbers is huge, we can't make use of the primary memory to serve the purpose.
1) Divide the numbers in group of k.
2) Sort each group independently in O(klogk). ( using internal sort - Quick Sort )
    Merge sort all the groups.
3) Create a min heap of size=10 billion/k.
4) Update the min heap with the minimum from each group.
5) Extract the minimum from the heap and write to a file.
6) Get the next number from the group from which extracted number belonged.
7) Update the min heap.
8) Go to step 5.



*Approach 2:- Using Doubly Ended Priority Queue (DEPQ)*

1) Read in as many elements as will fit into DEPQ.
   The elements in DEPQ will eventually be the middle group of elements.
2) Proces the remaining elements one at a time.
   If the next element <= smallest element in the DEPQ, output this element as a part of the left group.
   Else if the next element is greater  than the largest element in DEPQ, output it as a part of right group.
3) Otherwise, remove  either the min or max element from the DEPQ.
4) Output the elements in DEPQ in sorted order.
5) Sort the left and right groups recursively.

_In approach 2, we are simulating the quick sort, In quick sort , the array is broken into  L,M,R._
_where M is just a single pivot element. But in approach 2 , the whole DEPQ is acting as a pivot._

05/05/2020, 1:20 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): Then it'll increment
05/05/2020, 1:20 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): Toh i stays 0 always

05/05/2020, 1:23 pm - Tushar Nankani: You're basically assigning i = 0. And then incrementing the value to 1. But i is already assigned as 0. This process keeps getting repeated.
05/05/2020, 1:24 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): ‚úÖ‚úÖ

05/05/2020, 1:24 pm - Tushar Nankani: It's due to the post increment. If it was pre-increment: i = ++i, then it will increment to 1, then assign it to i. So in this case i remains 1.
05/05/2020, 1:25 pm - Mohit Varma (TSEC, CS): Oh ..got it

People who have been wanting/thinking to start off with competitive programming, I personally think this will be a good start.

As Codeforces has come up with the first ever Division 4 contest which will be held this Saturday 8th May.

You all can register right now:
https://codeforces.com/contests/1352

And you can read more about it here:
https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/77028
08/05/2020, 1:01 am - Tushar Nankani: 9th May* Saturday.
08/05/2020, 1:36 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): 1) All pending semester exams (except final semester) are effectively cancelled in Maharashtra.
2) Marks will be given according to UGC guidelines i.e. 50% marks based on this SEM internal assessment and 50% based on last semester exam performance.
3) If you are unhappy with this Sem marks, University will announce dates for Re-Exam which will probably be a 80 mark paper (not clarified as to of how many marks the re exam will be)
4) All those who fail in this Sem internal assessment will have to give exams in next sem or the Re-Exam as notified by the University.
5) All those already having ATKT in previous Sems will have to give exams for them within 120 days of college reopening, the timetable for which will be announced by respective university.

10/05/2020, 9:51 pm - Mohammed (TSEC, EXTC): You need to learn java or kotlin first

11/05/2020, 5:12 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Guys lmk your opinion on this:
Should I do both android dev and Problem Solving together?
11/05/2020, 5:13 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): See my problem solving is again lagging since I am doing android dev recently
11/05/2020, 5:13 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): And if I start problem solving again then... android bhul jata hai
11/05/2020, 5:13 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): The thing is that....I want to improve my problem solving day by day as well as keep adding projects to GitHub.... please do help me out here....
11/05/2020, 5:14 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Chip your opinions in plz....will be greatly appreciated
11/05/2020, 5:15 pm - Saurav Upoor (TSEC CS, SE): yes

11/05/2020, 7:22 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Don't 'keep adding projects to GitHub'. Neither is that the aim, nor is having a lot of projects the aim. The aim is to keep building up on a few projects.

11/05/2020, 8:27 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): OK, I thought that this was a native program. If you converted a .py file then it bundles the python interpreter as well.
11/05/2020, 8:28 pm - Farhan Irani (TSEC IT, SE): try it
11/05/2020, 8:29 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Yes, I am downloading the file.

11/05/2020, 8:36 pm - Farhan Irani (TSEC IT, SE): for the exe yes
11/05/2020, 8:36 pm - Farhan Irani (TSEC IT, SE): check the source files
11/05/2020, 8:36 pm - Farhan Irani (TSEC IT, SE): ive even included the option of setting your own board
11/05/2020, 8:36 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Also, you should not immediately inform the user if the entered number is wrong.

20/05/2020, 7:35 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): For eg, I can setup a GitLab CI action to run only when I push to a certain branch, and then automatically build, package and deploy a site, with different production and development instances.
Try doing that with GitLab Actions. Trust me, I have tried.

20/05/2020, 9:33 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Git is a part of DevOps.
GutHub is just a platform.
GitHub has other DevOps features like CI/CD.

@918080142783 am I correct?
20/05/2020, 9:35 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): This can be done with GitHub Actions.

Haven't experimented with CI/CD yet, so you might be right about the complicated nature of GitHub to that of GitLab. I have no idea...
20/05/2020, 9:38 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Almost.
GitHub has tried to integrate CI/CD into the workflow like GitLab.

28/05/2020, 2:28 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Yuppp
28/05/2020, 2:29 am - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): So plain CSS is the way to go?
28/05/2020, 2:29 am - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Vanilla* CSS
28/05/2020, 2:29 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): In my opinion: Always.
28/05/2020, 2:30 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): CSS => Complete Suffering & Sadness
28/05/2020, 2:30 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Ohh....
28/05/2020, 2:30 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Definitely look to libraries for inspiration, and feel free to copy whatever you like.
28/05/2020, 2:31 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Smart!
28/05/2020, 2:31 am - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Agreed
28/05/2020, 2:31 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): But I feel that the only time you should be using libraries is for prototypes, never for the final version of an app/website.
28/05/2020, 2:31 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): This way, you aren't really using the library, but you also are ......
28/05/2020, 2:31 am - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Ohh
Alright
28/05/2020, 2:31 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): ESPECIALLY CSS/JavaScript libraries.
28/05/2020, 2:32 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Oh ..
28/05/2020, 2:32 am - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): So I should not use Bootstrap, Materialize CSS, Tailwind CSS, etc for my projects...
28/05/2020, 2:33 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Unless the library ADDS critical functionality (eg: PDF parser, WebSocket management) you should think twice before using it.
28/05/2020, 2:33 am - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Oh
28/05/2020, 2:34 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Again, the decision is up to you, but I don't like to use these libraries.
28/05/2020, 2:34 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): You can achieve the same outcome with 0.1% of the code.
28/05/2020, 2:34 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): And I am not even joking, try measuring code coverage in DevTools.
28/05/2020, 2:34 am - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): What is a CDN is used?
28/05/2020, 2:34 am - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): If*
28/05/2020, 2:35 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): We're having real talks at 2.35 AM
This is fucking awesome!!!!!
28/05/2020, 2:35 am - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): üëèüëè
28/05/2020, 2:35 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): A CDN can only speed up the download times.
28/05/2020, 2:36 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): What I meant that most (small) projects do not even use 2-5% of the code in a huge library like jQuery or BootStrap.
28/05/2020, 2:37 am - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Agreed, but it only imports the code that is called...

Now if you're saying that that code is a lot as compared to when done with vanilla CSS, then you have to be good at that...

My vanilla CSS with flexbox looks like this:
https://harshkapadia2.github.io/lbl-tribute-page/
28/05/2020, 2:37 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): So even if you are using a CDN, and the library is 10,000 lines, then you are only using 100-150 lines.
28/05/2020, 2:38 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Which seems like a MASSIVE waste.
28/05/2020, 2:38 am - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): It's so garbage that if I used it in my full stack project, no one would come back to it
28/05/2020, 2:38 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): You sure do have a point 
But what if, I say I'm not really concerned abt frontend 
I don't want to waste my time adjusting padding and all etc.....

I just want to show off my backend functionality.....
Then what should I do?
28/05/2020, 2:38 am - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): The entire lib is called even when just a particular class is called?
28/05/2020, 2:40 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): If you include a script/library with a <script> or <link> tag, the ENTIRE file is downloaded even if you don't use a single line.
28/05/2020, 2:40 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): The Browser does not know what you will use, so it HAS to download, parse and execute the entire library.
28/05/2020, 2:40 am - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Oh yeah ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
28/05/2020, 2:40 am - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): True true
28/05/2020, 2:41 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): However, there is something called "Tree Shaking" where unused portions of the library are removed.
28/05/2020, 2:42 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): But even that is not as efficient because sometimes one function can call half the library.
28/05/2020, 2:42 am - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Ohh
28/05/2020, 2:42 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): And you lose the benefit of a CDN.
28/05/2020, 2:43 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): ?
28/05/2020, 2:44 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): OK, what backend functionality?
28/05/2020, 2:44 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Give me an example.
28/05/2020, 2:44 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Suppose, I'm building a rest api..
28/05/2020, 2:45 am - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Tbh I used a template for Attendance Manager v1
28/05/2020, 2:45 am - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): It was just a backend project then...
28/05/2020, 2:45 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Yeahh
You told me once ...
Now I remember....
28/05/2020, 2:45 am - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): For v2, we are making the front end ourselves and have redesigned the back end...
28/05/2020, 2:47 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): OK, if you are building a REST API, then by all means use BootStrap or Materialize for the demo website.
28/05/2020, 2:48 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): But you can still have a great website WITHOUT BootStrap.
28/05/2020, 2:48 am - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Now here we are using Bootstrap and when we add Flexbox, it fucks up the Bootstrap
28/05/2020, 2:48 am - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): No idea what should be done...
28/05/2020, 2:49 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Don't use flex box..
Why do you need??
28/05/2020, 2:50 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Bootstrap handles it all na?
28/05/2020, 2:54 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): I try to avoid BootStrap alltogether.
28/05/2020, 2:54 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Try CSS Grid.
28/05/2020, 2:55 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Ohh that is absolute beauty  .....
28/05/2020, 2:55 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): I've used it ....
28/05/2020, 2:55 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Its lengthy, 
But it works...
It works perfectly 
It works always....
28/05/2020, 2:56 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Somebody put it nicely: "Grid is how CSS should have been designed in the first place".
28/05/2020, 2:56 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Now, that you say it.....
28/05/2020, 2:56 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): üî•üî•
28/05/2020, 2:57 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Are you on Twitter M
28/05/2020, 2:57 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): ?*
28/05/2020, 2:57 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): No.
28/05/2020, 2:58 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Oh okay.....
28/05/2020, 2:58 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Why?
28/05/2020, 2:58 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Is v2 on GitHub?
28/05/2020, 2:58 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Wanted to tag ya
28/05/2020, 2:59 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Oh, ok.
28/05/2020, 2:59 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Also, I am not sure that using a server is important.
28/05/2020, 3:00 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): The advantage of not using libraries/frameworks is that the website is MUCH lighter, and hence most of the logic can be offloaded to the client.
28/05/2020, 3:00 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): It will greatly reduce the load on the server.
28/05/2020, 3:00 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Yeah...
28/05/2020, 3:01 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Also,
It  gives us a better understanding of what actually is happening....
28/05/2020, 3:01 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): You know, what you have coded and 
That's what you are seeing...
Not some pre written code, which you are using.....
28/05/2020, 3:03 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): There's one thing I give you,
The satisfaction of building a complete thing, from scratch, on our own, line by line is üòçüòçüòçüòç
28/05/2020, 3:07 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): The satisfaction of finishing a project is much greater.
I would say that if you feel that the only way that you can finish a project is to use a library, then go for it.
But you should definitely try to do at least one project without a library.
28/05/2020, 3:08 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): True!
I'll complete this project, with a library,
But the next one is definitely gonna be VANILLA EVERYTHING
28/05/2020, 3:12 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): If you want to try vanilla, your mother's website is a great project.https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_image_gallery.asp
28/05/2020, 3:12 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_image_gallery.asp
28/05/2020, 3:13 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): It is better to have a long, scrolling page that has all the images instead of having 5 links that people have to click on.
28/05/2020, 3:13 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): That is NEVER a good idea.
28/05/2020, 3:13 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): It makes it very difficult to view all the images.
28/05/2020, 3:14 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Ohhh
28/05/2020, 3:14 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): I thought, it made things easier to view category wise.....
28/05/2020, 3:15 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): If you would have only suggested me before I started!
Anyways...
Next time!
28/05/2020, 3:16 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Yes, but if I want to view all the images, then I have to click on each link, then click 20 times on the >> button.
28/05/2020, 3:17 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Yaa....
What I'll do is.....
28/05/2020, 3:17 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): I'll create a grid of all images
28/05/2020, 3:17 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): And
28/05/2020, 3:18 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): If someone wants to see an enlarged view, I'll add something like a pop-up feature 
When the user clicks on a particular image....
28/05/2020, 3:18 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Even now is not too late.
28/05/2020, 3:18 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): That is exactly what I had in mind.
28/05/2020, 3:18 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Like Google Images.
28/05/2020, 3:18 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Yeah...
28/05/2020, 3:19 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Cool!
My Gallery page is sorted now!
Thanks @918080142783
28/05/2020, 3:19 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): No problem.
28/05/2020, 3:19 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Let me know if you need help.
28/05/2020, 3:20 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Sure!!
28/05/2020, 3:20 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Also, a solid background color is quite boring.
28/05/2020, 3:20 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): It's a gradient....
28/05/2020, 3:21 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): What?
28/05/2020, 3:21 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Yeah....
28/05/2020, 3:22 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Well, it looks like a solid color.
28/05/2020, 3:22 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Wait
28/05/2020, 3:22 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Which one are you talking about?
28/05/2020, 3:22 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): I'm talking about this one....
28/05/2020, 3:23 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Pick a gradient somewhere like https://uigradients.com/ .
28/05/2020, 3:24 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Oh, I thought you were talking about https://dheerajdlalwani.github.io/ImageGallery/
28/05/2020, 3:24 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Yeah,
That was old version
28/05/2020, 3:24 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): The new one looks good, but the transitions seem a little... too flashy.
28/05/2020, 3:25 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): What about a simple, left to right translate?
28/05/2020, 3:25 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): That was like the first thing that popped up in Materialize CSS docsüòÖ
28/05/2020, 3:25 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): I'll change it to that
28/05/2020, 3:26 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Is the new website on GitHub?
28/05/2020, 3:26 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Less is always more!
Minimalistic design....
28/05/2020, 3:26 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Yes
28/05/2020, 3:26 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Not hosted though
28/05/2020, 3:27 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): No problem.
28/05/2020, 3:27 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): I'll send the link
28/05/2020, 3:27 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Do you know about http://htmlpreview.github.io/
28/05/2020, 3:27 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Noo!
28/05/2020, 3:27 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): I'll check it out!
28/05/2020, 3:28 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): But, it's a Django project
28/05/2020, 3:28 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): WHY?
28/05/2020, 3:28 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): It's a shop!üòÖ
28/05/2020, 3:28 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): E commerce
28/05/2020, 3:28 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): So?
28/05/2020, 3:29 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): I'll be adding payment gateways and all
28/05/2020, 3:29 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): E - commerce only makes sense if you will be getting at least 10 orders per day.
28/05/2020, 3:29 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): For practicing!!!
28/05/2020, 3:29 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): üòÖüòÖ
28/05/2020, 3:30 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Last time I checked, the seller registration was like 10,000 per month.
28/05/2020, 3:30 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): It might be better to take orders via phone or email.
28/05/2020, 3:30 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Hm....
28/05/2020, 3:31 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): I'm making this project to just explore....
And see how it feels ......
28/05/2020, 3:31 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Getting comfy with the tech...
28/05/2020, 3:31 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): My mom takes all orders via phone only.....
28/05/2020, 3:31 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Even then, building a payment gateway is not easy.
28/05/2020, 3:32 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): I've to just integrate right?
They're like ready made I saw in some Tutorials.....
28/05/2020, 3:32 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): If you seriously want to learn about accepting online payments, then it might be better to look into a payment service like BillDesk or Shopify.
28/05/2020, 3:33 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Hm.....
28/05/2020, 3:33 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): If you only want to integrate with an existing provider then you might be able to use the REST api directly.
28/05/2020, 3:33 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Without the need for a server.
28/05/2020, 3:34 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Okay...
This is more like PC
Let's pc
28/05/2020, 3:34 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): OK.

This guy has a *GREAT* point

Do reade the complete thread
01/06/2020, 11:59 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Damn, this is unique!

What are your thoughts @919689727471 and @918408867834?
02/06/2020, 12:00 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): I would suggest spending at least 30 minutes on each problem.
02/06/2020, 12:00 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): But otherwise, this is great advice.
02/06/2020, 12:01 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Hmm.....
02/06/2020, 12:12 am - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): This can be done for interview questions as they are repetitive. But in Cp, questions aren't that repetitive. Every question has something new. That's why for cp, you have to think for an hour at least on every problem that's hard for you. People spend days solving a single question in CodeChef Long Challenge(8 questions 10 days to solve). Questions are hard. But you get learn 5-6 different concepts by solving a single question.
02/06/2020, 12:14 am - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): This is if you're doing it for the love of CP, right? Would you recommend this for interviews as well?
02/06/2020, 12:15 am - +91 77385 57601: If you want to do hardcore cp then this might good for starting
02/06/2020, 12:15 am - +91 77385 57601: This is what i think
02/06/2020, 12:17 am - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): I haven't started with interview questions yet. But yeah you should think for an hour at least. That'll improve your problem solving skills. And in interviews, they won't ask you questions which are already there on gfg(for FAANG companies). They'll always slightly change the question. To solve the question during interview you should have excellent problem solving skills.
02/06/2020, 12:18 am - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): üëçüëç

05/06/2020, 4:08 pm - Pranav Dani: Usme bas ek pixel ka issue hai all the max values for RGB pixel are 255 and there's a formula to calculate the number for each R G B pixel and it actually comes around 254 and due to approximation of the formula to the nearest integer in Android it calculate the value as 256 and when you apply it you are screwed
It's prophoto RGB image so don't try it out
05/06/2020, 4:08 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Also, I wanted to check if using a custom launcher (like Nova Launcher) affects things.
05/06/2020, 4:09 pm - Pranav Dani: Nope it won't
05/06/2020, 4:09 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Why?
05/06/2020, 4:10 pm - Pranav Dani: When You set a wallpaper it is set in your system even if the app crashes the wallpaper won't change since you set it and there starts the loop crashes
05/06/2020, 4:14 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): The issue is that the system restarts the home process, which crashes, then restarts, then crashes, etc.
05/06/2020, 4:14 pm - Pranav Dani: Loop yes
05/06/2020, 4:15 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): If the wallpaper is a third party launcher, then the system will use the default home process.
05/06/2020, 4:17 pm - Pranav Dani: Go ahead try to install a launcher apply a wallpaper not that one and then uninstall the launcher the wallpaper stays the same
05/06/2020, 4:17 pm - Pranav Dani: Same matlab jo launcher se apply kiya tha
05/06/2020, 4:22 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): This message was deleted
05/06/2020, 4:22 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): read the comments sectionüòÇ
05/06/2020, 4:24 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): On my (Oppo) phone, whenever Nova Launcher crashes, the launcher changes to the system launcher, and the wallpaper resets.
05/06/2020, 4:24 pm - Pranav Dani: You may try applying your luck then
05/06/2020, 4:25 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Most definately NOT.
05/06/2020, 4:25 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): That is why I am asking someone to try in an emulator.
05/06/2020, 4:35 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Send this to Kajli ma'am @917738557601
05/06/2020, 4:36 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Problem solve teraüòÇ
05/06/2020, 4:38 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): I am not sure that she is capable of setting a wallpaper üòÇ.
05/06/2020, 4:38 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Downloading it is enough na
05/06/2020, 4:38 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): No, it has to be SET as a wallpaper.
05/06/2020, 4:39 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): * or displayed by the system in some manner, but then the system can just kill the task.
05/06/2020, 4:50 pm - +91 99693 94098: I'll try this when I get some time. Sounds like fun
If anything goes wrong, nandroid backup wtg üòÇ
05/06/2020, 4:53 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): All of you know how to use an emulator, right?
05/06/2020, 4:55 pm - +91 99693 94098: Yup
05/06/2020, 4:56 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Then WHY do you want to experiment on your phone?
05/06/2020, 4:57 pm - +91 99693 94098: Because I want to wipe it anyway before I permanently switch to Paranoid Android so might as well try this out
Plus this doesn't crash all phones so who knows ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüòÇ
05/06/2020, 4:57 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): OK that makes sense.
05/06/2020, 4:58 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): I prefer Lineange OS.
05/06/2020, 4:58 pm - +91 99693 94098: Lineage is too plain for my taste üòÇüòÇ
05/06/2020, 4:59 pm - +91 99693 94098: Also a nandroid backup is an ultimate backup so it's nothing more than a simple experiment
05/06/2020, 4:59 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Then try Resurrection Remix (RR).
05/06/2020, 4:59 pm - +91 99693 94098: That's outdated. No Q build either

05/06/2020, 4:59 pm - +91 99693 94098: RR hasn't been updated for a very long time actually
05/06/2020, 5:00 pm - +91 99693 94098: I've bricked mine wayyy too many times üòÇüòÇüòÇ

05/06/2020, 5:06 pm - +91 99693 94098: And I don't want to build on my own so I'm just avoiding it
05/06/2020, 5:06 pm - +91 88798 05171: rr is pretty old now, devs stopped compiling it because it was pretty unstable
05/06/2020, 5:07 pm - +91 88798 05171: and obv new roms came out which were better
05/06/2020, 5:08 pm - +91 99693 94098: I spoke to Akhil Narang who has a big contribution in RR and he said the same thing
05/06/2020, 5:08 pm - +91 99693 94098: The best ROM imo is AOSiP

05/06/2020, 5:51 pm - +91 97681 67131: Saw re.. They are biggest scam
05/06/2020, 5:52 pm - +91 99693 94098: True. Mi is so shit that you have to ask for their permission for bootloader unlock and uske baad bhi you have to wait for a minimum of 15days before you can actually do it. Biggest scam ever
05/06/2020, 5:53 pm - +91 97681 67131: I loved their irony buying ripapple.com and rip Samsung.com and selling their refurbished phones only by rebranding themüòÇüòÇ
05/06/2020, 5:54 pm - +91 88798 05171: But they have everything you want
05/06/2020, 5:54 pm - +91 97681 67131: These days I think all phones do it started by moto and Lenovo but it improves Androids privacy by having a locked bootloader it‚Äôs actually good as it makes hard to exploit a device with locked bootloader
05/06/2020, 5:54 pm - +91 88798 05171: There's no developement for op7
05/06/2020, 5:55 pm - +91 88798 05171: Its my first unrooted phoneüòÇ
05/06/2020, 5:56 pm - +91 99693 94098: 15 days wait time for a phone that I bought? Why can't I just unlock it immediately if I want to? Your device is linked to your mi account anyway so there's no way anyone else can do it
05/06/2020, 5:56 pm - +91 99693 94098: There is so much development for op7
05/06/2020, 5:57 pm - +91 99693 94098: I know like 3-4 main devs that develop for op7
05/06/2020, 5:57 pm - +91 88798 05171: Thats for pro
05/06/2020, 5:57 pm - +91 99693 94098: Nahi nahi
05/06/2020, 5:57 pm - +91 88798 05171: Been a while I've checked XDA
05/06/2020, 5:58 pm - +91 99693 94098: Karle. Kaafi saare ROMs hai OP7 ke liye
05/06/2020, 5:59 pm - +91 88798 05171: Jab mene dekha tha tab lineage tak nahi tha
05/06/2020, 6:00 pm - +91 99693 94098: I know op7 ka PE dev. Baalaji. He used to develop for my device before
05/06/2020, 6:01 pm - +91 97681 67131: Moto and pixel give code immediately though. See bootloader is a integral part of os without its correct flashing device does not work. If ur device came with preunlocked bootloader biggest issue comes with sim locked devices in USA they can be easily exploited and this is how telephone providers were loosing lot of money. This is when moto started with locked bootloader and see xda forums nobody has found exploit for it yet. Also unlocked bootloader gives u permission to flash custom recovery after custom recovery u install custom rom and bam u bypass mi account wala lock and now u can use the stolen phones that‚Äôs the reason locked bootloader are better
05/06/2020, 6:02 pm - +91 97681 67131: Lineage OS surely would be there as lots of old CYnogen mod developers working on lineage OS and one plus and cynogen go way back
05/06/2020, 6:04 pm - +91 88798 05171: tele group nikal na op7 ka, xda doesnt even have an official lineage thread
05/06/2020, 6:04 pm - +91 99693 94098: I know this re üòÇüòÇ
I'm saying that all phones have a security check before you can unlock(some kind of login or something) so no random person can do it. If you're giving your login credentials and you're still not able to unlock the bootloader immediately then what's the use? 
Flashing a custom recovery, etc comes much later. ADB doesn't allow that anyway before you unlock the bootlader

05/06/2020, 6:06 pm - +91 97681 67131: Ya... now providing what moto calls unique key for bootloader unlocking that‚Äôs up to manufacturer re. Before doing that they have too check if device has valid purchase date etc now moto does it on site and gives code immediately I have never tried on mi device that‚Äôs issue with xiomi

05/06/2020, 6:08 pm - +91 88798 05171: might be a recovery
05/06/2020, 6:08 pm - +91 99693 94098: Rip I guess op7 doesn't have it
05/06/2020, 6:08 pm - +91 99693 94098: Yes
05/06/2020, 6:08 pm - +91 97681 67131: It would have pixel experience rom see that‚Äôs a lot popular on one plus devices these days

10/06/2020, 6:15 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Yes me too
10/06/2020, 6:21 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): I mean go ahead, it's your choice.

Also, WSL2 is out (if you've updated to Win 10 version 2004), so you can start using the new Ubuntu 20.04 LTS with it and also use the new Windows Terminal.

Hmu if you need any help with that. I have done it myself and have gists with all the reqd links and stuff...
10/06/2020, 6:21 pm - +91 77385 57601: Do you make gists for everything you do?
10/06/2020, 6:21 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Yes
10/06/2020, 6:21 pm - +91 77385 57601: Ohh great
10/06/2020, 6:21 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): I'll hit you up in 3 days
10/06/2020, 6:21 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Documentation is VERY important!
10/06/2020, 6:22 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Personally, could not recommed Docker highly enough.
10/06/2020, 6:22 pm - +91 77385 57601: I'm not really good mdüòÖ
10/06/2020, 6:22 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): MUCH better than WSL, as you can have separate, disposable containers.
10/06/2020, 6:22 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Oh yeah even Docker is amazing and it's supported via a nice GUI if you've updated to Win 10 version 2004.
10/06/2020, 6:22 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): GUI?
10/06/2020, 6:22 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): What GUI?
10/06/2020, 6:23 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Docker has started supporting Win 10 Home as well
10/06/2020, 6:23 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Yes, that is with VirtualBox.
10/06/2020, 6:24 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): I think they did away with that in the 2004 version. Not sure though...
10/06/2020, 6:24 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): But updataing to Pro is trivial.

https://github.com/CHEF-KOCH/KMS-activator
10/06/2020, 6:24 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): 10/10 would recommend.
10/06/2020, 6:25 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Especially if you want to work with large projects.
10/06/2020, 6:25 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Yeah I never said that you should upgrade to Pro
10/06/2020, 6:25 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Explain this is simple terms lol
10/06/2020, 6:29 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Windows has an in-built mechanic to check activation with *any* Key Management Server (KMS).
This is usually used in corporate enviorments where internet access is a security issue.
But you can setup a KMS server ON THE SAME PC and Windows will happily ask the server if the liscence is still valid.
10/06/2020, 6:30 pm - +91 77385 57601: Is it like piracy?
10/06/2020, 6:31 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Oh lol üòÇ
10/06/2020, 6:31 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Why have they not done something to solve it!?
10/06/2020, 6:31 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): So the exchange goes like this:
Windows to Server: Is my license still valid?
Server to Windows: Of course! üòâ
Windows: OK then.
10/06/2020, 6:31 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): üòÇ
10/06/2020, 6:32 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Yes, but you are not modifying the software, just using in-built mechanisms in un-intended ways.
10/06/2020, 6:32 pm - +91 77385 57601: Ironically it is hosted on GitHubüòÇüòÇ
10/06/2020, 6:33 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Yes. But not a lot of people know about this or have the patience to read the README.
10/06/2020, 6:34 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): üòÖ
10/06/2020, 6:50 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): That will be VERY difficult, since Microsoft mainly relys on the backwords-compatibility of Windows. Otherwise all businesses would have switched to Linux.
10/06/2020, 6:50 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): You can actually run a Windows 98 program on Windows 10 and it shoud run fine.
10/06/2020, 6:50 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): PS: This works for Office as well.
10/06/2020, 7:02 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Woah

Notepad++ is a good standalone editor. So is VSCode.
But DON'T USE NOTEPAD.
12/06/2020, 10:39 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): True
12/06/2020, 10:40 pm - +91 77385 57601: IDE's help you a lot!!!
12/06/2020, 10:43 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Exactly 
You don't want the beginner to get too much help
12/06/2020, 10:44 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Then you use Bluej
12/06/2020, 10:44 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Its just perfect,just like a text editor,no auto-complete
12/06/2020, 10:45 pm - +91 77385 57601: Why??üôÑüò∂
12/06/2020, 10:46 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): The beginner should be able to figure it out himself, where he went wrong 
Rather than the ide just helping him fix the errors
12/06/2020, 10:47 pm - +91 77385 57601: Ide does show you the errors
12/06/2020, 10:53 pm - +91 77385 57601: And getting stuck at such a trivial issues is so demotivating for a beginner
12/06/2020, 10:54 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): This is true
12/06/2020, 11:04 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): I know 
Been there....
But, 
I also used an IDE only....
12/06/2020, 11:05 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): But I realized, in order to get perfect....
I would have done better if I had done it on a simple text editor
12/06/2020, 11:05 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Do watch Tech With Tim's video on this topic
12/06/2020, 11:06 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): https://youtu.be/oij82Cp9K1A
12/06/2020, 11:07 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): I feel that 
Immediate help is harmful
12/06/2020, 11:07 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Notepad++ provides only syntax highlighting. I think that is a quite helpfully, especially for a beginner.
12/06/2020, 11:08 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Bluej is the best for beginners imo,we used that in school too
12/06/2020, 11:09 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Not using an IDE is like learning to ride a bike without training wheels.
Yes, it is possible but there is no major benefit.
12/06/2020, 11:14 pm - +91 77385 57601: True that
12/06/2020, 11:17 pm - +91 77385 57601: Which language?
12/06/2020, 11:17 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Python
12/06/2020, 11:17 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): C++
12/06/2020, 11:19 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): I find Python impossible to code without an IDE.
Especially without a mononspace font. I really don't like the syntax.
12/06/2020, 11:19 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Ahh
I know thatüòÖüòÖ
12/06/2020, 11:20 pm - +91 77385 57601: Python have a really steep learning curve for people from another language which have brackets
12/06/2020, 11:21 pm - +91 77385 57601: It's very hard to get used to those whitespaces
12/06/2020, 11:21 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Its not just the whitespaces, Python has vary strange behaviour.
12/06/2020, 11:21 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): *very.
12/06/2020, 11:22 pm - +91 77385 57601: IküòÇ
12/06/2020, 11:22 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): I cannot do ```"I have " + 5 + " Apples"```.

12/06/2020, 11:23 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): But I call a function with missing arguments?
12/06/2020, 11:23 pm - +91 77385 57601: üòÇüòÇ
12/06/2020, 11:23 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Im uncomfortable with Python syntax frü§£
12/06/2020, 11:24 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): JAVA ALLOWS THIS.
C++ ALLOWS THIS.
BOTH ARE MORE STRONGLY TYPED THAN PYTHON.
12/06/2020, 11:24 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): And initializing multi-dimension arrays is horrible.
12/06/2020, 11:24 pm - +91 77385 57601: If you are using a statically typed language ide helps a lot
12/06/2020, 11:25 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): If you are using a ~statically typed~ language ide helps a lot.
12/06/2020, 11:26 pm - +91 77385 57601: And i can't find a reason of not using an ide if you are always going to use an ide
12/06/2020, 11:26 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Y'all, hating python so much makes me sad

12/06/2020, 11:27 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Python has a statement to do nothing.

12/06/2020, 11:27 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Watch the video
12/06/2020, 11:27 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): .
12/06/2020, 11:27 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Thanks!
12/06/2020, 11:27 pm - +91 77385 57601: I watched this
12/06/2020, 11:27 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Oh
12/06/2020, 11:27 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Idk why but I really hate Python
12/06/2020, 11:28 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Dream come trueüòÇ
Now, to do nothing also, I'm accounted for üòÇ
12/06/2020, 11:28 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Another disadvantage that its Dynamically typed
12/06/2020, 11:29 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): <Media omitted>
12/06/2020, 11:30 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): It is a good learning experience, you should know how to compile programs.
Syntax hilighing is a different story.
There is no good reason to not use syntax hilighting.
12/06/2020, 11:30 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): I have literally seen solutions in Perl which kill a huge solution in a line
12/06/2020, 11:30 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Yeah...
12/06/2020, 11:30 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): On codeforces
12/06/2020, 11:30 pm - +91 77385 57601: I never wrote a line of code without an ide but still ik what error I'm getting. What i feel is that learning a language takes time but demotivating yourself of by getting stuck at simple issues is not acceptable.
12/06/2020, 11:31 pm - +91 77385 57601: Yes
12/06/2020, 11:31 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): It is less about the error and more about knowing how to work with simple tools.
12/06/2020, 11:32 pm - +91 77385 57601: I gave example of error
12/06/2020, 11:32 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Syntax highlighting is necessary 
But, 
Autocomplete nahi yaar...
I've grown so used to it
That 
I keep forgetting the syntax
12/06/2020, 11:33 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Except in certain circumstances (Static code analysis), all the IDE does is display the error thrown by the compiler in a different way.
You should know how to read throught logs and error messages to find what is relevant.
12/06/2020, 11:35 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Its a nightmare to read the logs
12/06/2020, 11:36 pm - +91 77385 57601: Ganda hai par dhanda haiüòÇüòÇ
12/06/2020, 11:36 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): > I keep forgetting the syntax
There is NO GOOD REASON to remember syntax. Can you remember every word in the dictionary? Then why do you want to memorize an entire language
12/06/2020, 11:36 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Interview purpose

I can never remember if it is ```setTimeout(function, time)``` or ```setTimeout(time, function)```.
I look it up whenever I need to.
12/06/2020, 11:39 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Ham JavaScript tak pahuche hi nahiüôà

12/06/2020, 11:39 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): I agree 
That coding is about 
How better your Googling Skills are....

But for the sake of efficiency
12/06/2020, 11:40 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): If, we have this rigid practice of typing out the whole code.....
12/06/2020, 11:40 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): For projects,hell no
12/06/2020, 11:40 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Then, couple that with the autocomplete
12/06/2020, 11:41 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): This makes it faster
12/06/2020, 11:41 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Couple the practice with autocomplete 
Your efficiency increases √ó3
12/06/2020, 11:41 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Exactly
12/06/2020, 11:41 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Obviously
12/06/2020, 11:41 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): I'm saying 
While learning basics of coding
12/06/2020, 11:41 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Initial stages
12/06/2020, 11:42 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Yes
12/06/2020, 11:42 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): When, we are learning the fundamentals
12/06/2020, 11:42 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): If, we get used to autocomplete
12/06/2020, 11:42 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Then we won't learn the language
12/06/2020, 11:42 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Properly
12/06/2020, 11:43 pm - +91 77385 57601: Bhai but you will always have autocomplete
12/06/2020, 11:43 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Yaar example de raha tha.
12/06/2020, 11:43 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Smjh gaua
12/06/2020, 11:44 pm - +91 77385 57601: And we don't need to know all the functions and parms
12/06/2020, 11:44 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Java mai bhi huge functions , can't remember
12/06/2020, 11:44 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): All
12/06/2020, 11:44 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Agreed bhai
12/06/2020, 11:44 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Just for initial stages yaar.....
12/06/2020, 11:45 pm - +91 77385 57601: @918451904417 if you are going to learn a new language are you going to use notepad again?
12/06/2020, 11:45 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Not note pad
But yes notepad++
12/06/2020, 11:45 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Planning to use for Golang
12/06/2020, 11:46 pm - +91 77385 57601: And remember all the syntax of all languages you know?
12/06/2020, 11:46 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Cause, 
I messed up my initial learning
12/06/2020, 11:46 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Obviously not everything
12/06/2020, 11:47 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): But, yes
Atleast some of it

14/06/2020, 1:57 pm - Prithvi Rohira (TSEC, CS): I wasn't able to link sublime text with the command prompt after downloading node JS.
However now I can do it
14/06/2020, 3:45 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): If you're talking about having an inbuilt terminal in Sublime Text, maybe https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31439023/sublime-text-3-integrated-terminal/55484753#55484753 will help you.

I would suggest switching to VS Code for web dev though. Lmk if you want links to set up VS Code (extensions and stuff).
14/06/2020, 5:03 pm - Farhan Irani (TSEC IT, SE): Vs code lit

Keep asking!
25/06/2020, 11:35 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): He told project-based will help you a lot in the long run.
You might miss out on the nitty gritties of the particular language. But that's fine.
For beginners, what should do is, find a course which teaches by walking through a particular project. That would be really beneficial.
25/06/2020, 11:37 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Definitely agree with this!

Get started with a quick tutorial and then learn as per requirements...

26/06/2020, 10:46 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): But remember,
Chrome was the first browser to bring the concept of Threading. 
That means if multiple tabs are open, and if one tab hangs, rest all work.
Before that, in firefox, if there are 10 tabs open and if 1 tab also stops working 
It used to crash the browser. 
Everyone else copied.
26/06/2020, 10:47 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Ah get it
26/06/2020, 10:47 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Multithreading?

26/06/2020, 12:03 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Yeah, but people are slowly migrating imo.

Brave, Edge, Firefox and some of the popular ones...

I personally use Edge because Microsoft atleast optimizes its perf (even though it is Chromium)
26/06/2020, 12:03 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Are*
26/06/2020, 12:04 pm - Pranav Dani: Yeah True

26/06/2020, 12:33 pm - +91 80979 84068: Hi guys! 

So I was thinking most of us want to start with ML ,DAta science , AI but don‚Äôt exactly know where to start from, so I‚Äôm forming a group where we‚Äôll start working on projects together . We‚Äôll start with v basic projects starting from Python ke basics and will go on aage (ITS OKAY IF YOU DON‚ÄôT KNOW MUCH WE ALL ARE LEARNING HERE ) 

- we will refer to 1YouTube video focusing on 1 project for a week and try to make and learn on our own . 
- if we don‚Äôt understand any concept or anything from the video we‚Äôlltry to reverse engineer it and help others in the group as well.

People who are interested can join this group

 You all can share it with people if you want

26/06/2020, 12:41 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): I mostly use Chrome or FireFox.
Chrome becuase you cannot deny the rapid pace of new features.
FireFox because it is open source.
26/06/2020, 12:41 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Let us hope that the browser market becomes more diverse.

 Also I was thinking it‚Äôll be great if we put up our projects on GitHub as it‚Äôll help us keep a record of our progress so Harsh Kapadia‚Å© has decided to help us with Git and GitHub. He will be taking a live hands on session tomorrow(ie Sunday)
and I have posted a poll  regarding the same there please join the group and vote so we know when to keep the session

28/06/2020, 9:23 pm - +91 75078 05454: This looks interesting. But it looks like a customisable yet limited platform specifically created for development of apps for internal business use something like a project management app.
28/06/2020, 9:25 pm - +91 75078 05454: It's an interesting move of Amazon's part. They are trying to migrate people who are using Google docs or microsoft excel to this platform which is powered by AWS.
28/06/2020, 9:25 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): How exactly/
28/06/2020, 9:26 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): This is an app development platform, right?
28/06/2020, 9:26 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Not an Excel or Google Sheets clone.
28/06/2020, 9:29 pm - +91 75078 05454: Businesses use spreadsheets for managing projects that is what they are trying to replace.
28/06/2020, 9:29 pm - +91 75078 05454: Not something like data analysis or financial analysis done using spreadsheets
28/06/2020, 9:33 pm - +91 75078 05454: They are basically trying to solve the problem of using spreadsheets where they are not supposed to be conventionally used .
28/06/2020, 9:33 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): OK, that makes some sense.
28/06/2020, 9:36 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): üëçüëç

28/06/2020, 9:39 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): *Some* sense. I am still not completely sure if that is the real goal.
28/06/2020, 9:39 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): üòÇ
28/06/2020, 9:40 pm - +91 80979 84068: üòÇ

28/06/2020, 9:53 pm - +91 75078 05454: What is your opinion?
28/06/2020, 10:02 pm - +91 75078 05454: The real goal is definitely not to be an excel clone but to provide an effective way of creating apps for internal operations
28/06/2020, 10:03 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): My point exactly.
28/06/2020, 10:03 pm - +91 75078 05454: But they are going to have a huge advantage once the entire company moves to their platform for all internal operations
28/06/2020, 10:04 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): While this is certainly possible, I don't think that this is the first use-case to come to mind.
28/06/2020, 10:05 pm - +91 75078 05454: ?
28/06/2020, 10:07 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): I mean that it is possible to do data-analysis and manage projects on the platform, but that is not what I would use the platform for.
28/06/2020, 10:08 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): I would use it for rapid prototypes and proof of concepts.
28/06/2020, 10:08 pm - +91 75078 05454: That's definitely a very good use case but depends on the capability of the platform
28/06/2020, 10:09 pm - +91 75078 05454: From their campaign it looks like a platform for making apps for internal operations for businesses
28/06/2020, 10:10 pm - +91 75078 05454: But there is definitely a possibility of that turning into something like WordPress
28/06/2020, 10:11 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): I feel that Wordpress gained it's popularity because it was so open.
28/06/2020, 10:12 pm - +91 75078 05454: That's what I am saying the range of use cases will depend upon the flexibility of the platform
28/06/2020, 10:13 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): That is true.
28/06/2020, 10:14 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): But I don't think that companies will be willing to trust Amazon with their business logic.
28/06/2020, 10:15 pm - +91 75078 05454: Yeah that's true
28/06/2020, 11:36 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Same. Even I was surprised when I read that üòÇ

Only 5 numbers after . Point

01/07/2020, 5:17 pm - +91 73043 57388: Ya but it seems they are only used while printing a double number

I wanna store number

01/07/2020, 5:17 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Or a string.
01/07/2020, 5:17 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): hmm
01/07/2020, 5:21 pm - +91 73043 57388: Yes we will convert it to a string but first the numbers p and q are divided then their result is stored in string
01/07/2020, 5:22 pm - +91 73043 57388: I even used long double but still doesn't getting more than 5 digits
01/07/2020, 5:26 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): You will have to do the division process in small small steps
01/07/2020, 5:27 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): And store the number decimal by decimal by appending the string.
01/07/2020, 5:28 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): There was a similar problem on code chef
Where you had to find the factorial of numbers > 21 
Suppose you have to calculate 100!
01/07/2020, 5:28 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): You have to write a special algorithm for division
01/07/2020, 5:28 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): correct
01/07/2020, 5:29 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): simulate the division process
01/07/2020, 5:29 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): I have the solution for this.
You can read and then write the required algorithm for division.
01/07/2020, 5:29 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Yess.

01/07/2020, 5:56 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Python actually goes one step further, all intergers are automatically converted to bigints when they get larger than 32 bits.
```>>> f = 1
>>> for i in range(2, 101):
...     f *= i
...
>>> f

06/07/2020, 7:26 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): It would be better if you can tell us what exactly you are trying to do.
06/07/2020, 8:15 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): I'm trying to create tables.

For example, if I do it normally, in MySQL, I can use foreign key to links 2 tables.

I want to understand 
How to do that using classes in Python. 

But, never mind, I'll look it up and experiment so that, understand.
06/07/2020, 8:16 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): I was looking for a shortcut, like if someone has done it, I would have just asked how, but I'll do it on my own only.

Thanks anyways üòÖ
06/07/2020, 8:59 pm - Shubham Chettiar (TSEC CS, TE): There is a field called ForeignKey in django models, which works exactly like the Foreign key in SQL
06/07/2020, 11:15 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): I had a question,is there any harm in putting semicolon at the end of every statement in MySQL?
06/07/2020, 11:17 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): or can some1 just tell me when are semi-colons reqd. in SQL,I am kinda confused with this as  I saw tutorials where they almost never use it
06/07/2020, 11:18 pm - +91 82916 21138: Actually semicolon is used to end a query.
06/07/2020, 11:23 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): yes got it now'
07/07/2020, 12:11 am - Vivek Iyer (TSEC, Biomed): In python u can use range function to create table
07/07/2020, 12:11 am - Vivek Iyer (TSEC, Biomed): Tables*
07/07/2020, 1:23 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): ^[^aeiou]
07/07/2020, 1:23 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): can any1 explain what this means in SQL
07/07/2020, 1:23 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): its a regex
07/07/2020, 1:24 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): No no,
I'm talking about Django 
Class based SQL tables for backend
07/07/2020, 1:48 am - Tushar Nankani: This type of regex probably means it should start with _aeiou._
07/07/2020, 1:51 am - Tushar Nankani: And it should probably be ```^[aeiou]```. I am not too sure.

07/07/2020, 1:59 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): There was a problem on hackerrank to select names of cities from a table with should not start or end with a vowel and this worked
07/07/2020, 2:30 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): If the first character of a class is ^ then it negates the class.

07/07/2020, 6:24 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): With reference to git bash
07/07/2020, 6:57 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): touch will create a 0 length file called README.md.
notepad will open README.md in notepad.

07/07/2020, 8:23 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): The program did not compile/start on time.
07/07/2020, 8:23 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): But it is not the program's fault.

07/07/2020, 9:19 pm - Saurav Upoor (TSEC CS, SE): I think you get that for interactive problems
07/07/2020, 9:20 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): Yeah when the program doesn't output anything
07/07/2020, 9:21 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): Idleness limit exceeded occurs when your program stays idle (waiting for user/interaction program) for long time.

I'm not sure why is it not WA instead of Idleness limit exceeded. My guess is that interaction program expects a newline and thus keeps on waiting for your program.
07/07/2020, 9:21 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): cf blog

07/07/2020, 9:51 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): This is to define a new remote?
07/07/2020, 9:52 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): No, this is to CHANGE the url of the remote named "origin".
07/07/2020, 9:53 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Ohküëç

08/07/2020, 11:09 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): I don't want anything, Tanay was looking for something to write his notes in.
I suggested either GitHub repos, GitHub Gists or just commenting the notes in shorthand in the tutorial project that he builds while watching the video side by side.

10/07/2020, 5:13 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Depends. You should read the changelog and see if new features were added.
10/07/2020, 5:13 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): will check
10/07/2020, 5:13 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): For example git sparse-checkout was added in a 0.1 update.
10/07/2020, 5:13 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): oh
10/07/2020, 5:13 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): And so was git switch and git restore.
10/07/2020, 5:14 pm - +91 77385 57601: Yaa but most of the time .01 is likely to be a bug fix
10/07/2020, 5:14 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Yes, most of the time it is true.
10/07/2020, 5:15 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): But somtimes features are added/changed from experimental to stable.
10/07/2020, 5:15 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Best way is to read the changelog.
10/07/2020, 5:21 pm - +91 77385 57601: U have sooo many things on your device it is very tough to read all the changelogs... especially for a person like who rarely updatesüòÖ

10/07/2020, 7:21 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Not technially, no.
10/07/2020, 7:21 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): It was developed as a package mangager for Mac.
10/07/2020, 7:22 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): But what is HomeBrew?
10/07/2020, 7:22 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Similar to apt and apk.
10/07/2020, 7:22 pm - +91 97681 67131: Package manager like Linux has apt...
10/07/2020, 7:22 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Exactly.
10/07/2020, 7:23 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): It is also availiable for linux.
10/07/2020, 7:24 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): It has limited use, except in very rare situations.
One thing it does differently is it installs all software to the USER's partition instead of system.
10/07/2020, 7:24 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Means you don't have to be root to install software.
10/07/2020, 7:25 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): You can "isolate" brew to one directory and it will not touch anything outside that directory.
10/07/2020, 7:25 pm - +91 97681 67131: Are u trying to install git?? That‚Äôs why asking for home brew? For example if I needed to install git on OS X u can use home brew as ur package manager. This will automatically install all the Xcode command line tools recquired for git to run on ur mac
10/07/2020, 7:26 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): Yeah
10/07/2020, 7:26 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): Oh acha
10/07/2020, 7:28 pm - +91 97681 67131: Thought so, I also did the same recently üòÖ. Anyway, instead of manually installing full Xcode and command line tools, this package manager will only install the needed libraries for vcs system like git to work on OS X
10/07/2020, 7:28 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): I think you can just do ```git``` on the command line and it will propmpt for installation.
10/07/2020, 7:28 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git#_installing_on_macos
10/07/2020, 7:28 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): Yeahh thats what i did
10/07/2020, 7:28 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): Yeah
10/07/2020, 7:28 pm - +91 97681 67131: I don‚Äôt think that works in terminal on OSX
10/07/2020, 7:29 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): not only git i did 'brew install git'
10/07/2020, 7:30 pm - +91 97681 67131: Did u first try installing homebrew, wait I‚Äôll share tutorials I followed... just a sec
10/07/2020, 7:31 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): Yeah i installed HomeBrew first
10/07/2020, 7:31 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): then through terminal i did brew install git
10/07/2020, 7:32 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): but it seems ki when you install Xcode , git gets installed too
10/07/2020, 7:32 pm - +91 97681 67131: Oh then do u have Xcode installed and before that pls check software update section, command line tools installing happens from there...
10/07/2020, 7:32 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): Yeah i have Xcode
10/07/2020, 7:33 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): Software update section?
10/07/2020, 7:33 pm - +91 97681 67131: Nope it‚Äôs not needed to install Xcode just command line tools are necessary mostly but check software update section, they are installed from there
10/07/2020, 7:33 pm - +91 97681 67131: I mean where u get os updates
10/07/2020, 7:34 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): It just shows Your mac is up to date
10/07/2020, 7:35 pm - +91 97681 67131: Try running git‚Äîversion command is it giving back any version or no ?? If not I think some installing issue.. I will find tutorial I used.
10/07/2020, 7:36 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): Yeah it gives the version number
10/07/2020, 7:36 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): git is installed
10/07/2020, 7:36 pm - +91 97681 67131: Then it‚Äôs installed
10/07/2020, 7:36 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): just wanted to know about Home Brew
10/07/2020, 7:36 pm - +91 97681 67131: Oh üòÇ Ya oh I thought stuck with installing
10/07/2020, 7:37 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): loll
10/07/2020, 7:37 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): XCode has old packages sometimes.
Note that the latest git version is 2.27.0.
10/07/2020, 7:38 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): I'll check
10/07/2020, 7:38 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): just a sec
10/07/2020, 7:38 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): Yup its 2.27.0
10/07/2020, 7:38 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Great!
10/07/2020, 7:39 pm - +91 97681 67131: Homebrew is just a command line package manager like Kartik and I said what we have in in Linux, like apt, debians dpkg etc
10/07/2020, 7:39 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): Thanks @918080142783 and @919768167131 !
10/07/2020, 7:39 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): Yeah abhi i got to know

10/07/2020, 7:40 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Just a side note, dpkg is just a package installer, it will not download dependencies.
10/07/2020, 7:40 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): apt uses dpkg internally.
10/07/2020, 7:40 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): It went over my head lol
10/07/2020, 7:40 pm - +91 97681 67131: Ya ya.. it‚Äôs installer sorry
10/07/2020, 7:42 pm - +91 97681 67131: But ig installers can be considered a part of package manger.. right??
10/07/2020, 7:43 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Basically if you do ``apt install git``` then it will automatically download and install git, curl and all the other dependencies.
But for dpkg, you have to manually download git.deb, curl.deb, etc. and install them one by one in the correct order.
10/07/2020, 7:43 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Yes, definately. Package installers are the most important part of a package manager.

18/07/2020, 10:41 am - +91 82916 21138: The following order of learning would make sense.

Core Java - it is important to start with core Java for understanding the fundamental in Java programming.

Servlets - JSP and Servlet are important to understand the web technologies

Java EE

Spring Framework

Hibernate Framework



Java is a very vast language and used in various forms like Socket programming, Web Application development, Portal designing, Android applications, Purely Backend developments using Webservices and lot more. So first decide what you want to learn.

Learn accordingly.

1. Core Java : Most Important . Learn all the concepts don‚Äôt miss a single one. Its the heart and soul of Java

2. JSP and Servlet : These are basics of Web application development. Earlier all the applications were made using these technology but now they are just a part of Web development.

3. JDBC : You should be familiar with this concepts . Your daily life belongs to this only. Learn basics of SQL language also for CRUD operation.

4.Spring: The most useful framework which is used for various applications .

5.Hibernate: Its useful for DB interaction at the highest speed.

You can follow the 12345 all for a Spring web application development.

You can follow 1235 for Hibernate developer.

You can learn only 1 for Socket programming.

If you want to be a Android developer then learn only 1 and then proceed to android studio.

Except this you can learn JSF and Webservices for better knowledge and work

19/07/2020, 10:26 am - +91 82916 21138: Prashasti Agarwal:
I am graduating this year and I have job offer of 3-4 LPA. Should I focus on preparing for GATE or for DSA and CP?

Satbir Singh:
It's your wish. Remember GATE will give one chance per year to prove your worth whereas if you do CP and you're prepared you can get many chance to attend various interviews.

Anurag Goel:
After doing GATE, you will be doing M.Tech and again focussing on coding skills, Cp and DSA  for placement season after 2 years. 

So it would be better if you switch your 3-4 lpa to 8-10+ lpa in product based company by learning those coding skills self. 
I've been exactly at the same position as you are today and can feel the dilemma but if job is the end goal, better to grind yourself now with DSA coding skills along with existing job.

19/07/2020, 2:58 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Hey this is nice, @918291679151!

My opinions:
- In mobile view, get the number pad above the operator pad
- Make the operators visible in the box.
- The press handling is a little difficult. (Idk how you can improve that...)

- Add CSS transitions (literally 1 line of CSS)
- Adjust the padding so that there are no scrollbars (at least on Desktop)
- It is very bad practice for UI to shift. Make your buttons not shift on hover.

This happens when you've already created a table in the database which has a few entries and now you try to add a new column
So what django is saying is that since the field you've given is non-nullable, django can't just give null value to it, and so, you'll have to assign a default value to all the existing entries in the table
20/07/2020, 10:33 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Yes correct. 
I just wanted to change.
Needed to add 2 columns

22/07/2020, 5:22 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): ```int largestPrimeFactor(int n){
    if(n <= 3)
        return n;
    
    int f = 1;
    while(n > 1){
        f++;
        while(n % f == 0)
            n /= f;
    }
    
    return f;
}```
22/07/2020, 5:23 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): You have to add logic to handle 0 and negative numbers.
22/07/2020, 5:26 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): ```
vector<int> divs;
int check(int x) {
    if(x <= 1) return -1;
    
    for (int i = 2; i * i <= x ; ++i) {
        if(x%i == 0) {
           divs.push_back(i);
           while(x % i == 0) {
               x = x / i;
           }
        }
    }
    
    if(divs.empty())divs.push_back(x);
    
    return divs.back();
}```
22/07/2020, 5:26 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): try this
22/07/2020, 5:29 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): 1. Java
2. No need for a vector
22/07/2020, 5:29 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): this will TLE if n is prime. But I think there isn't any time constraint on Udemy, so this will also work
22/07/2020, 5:30 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Why?
22/07/2020, 5:30 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): Lets say N is 10^9 + 7
22/07/2020, 5:30 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Use n = 5
22/07/2020, 5:30 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): your loop will run 10^9 + 7 times
22/07/2020, 5:31 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): ?
22/07/2020, 5:31 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Easier.
22/07/2020, 5:31 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): And no.
22/07/2020, 5:31 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Wait, is 10e9 + 7 prime?
22/07/2020, 5:31 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): Yes it will
22/07/2020, 5:31 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): yeah
22/07/2020, 5:31 pm - Tushar Nankani: Yes.
22/07/2020, 5:31 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Ah, then yes.
22/07/2020, 5:32 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): Here I have optimized it. Consider any number N, if its not prime then it'll definitely have a factor <= sqrt(N)
22/07/2020, 5:33 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): so Time Complexity is O(sqrt(n))
22/07/2020, 5:33 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): I was aiming for simplicity, but OK.
22/07/2020, 5:33 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): Yeah both solutions should work

XAMPP is very tedious if you mess something up.

So mujhe har object ko retrive karke usko HTML pe div mei styling karna hai toh kaise karengay?
07/08/2020, 2:10 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Example?
07/08/2020, 2:10 pm - +91 73043 57388: Job listing

07/08/2020, 2:14 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): So write a function to take the json data and create the required markup.
07/08/2020, 2:14 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Have a for loop in the templating syntax that you're using and then add the necessary data in that

The code is a little complex, but you should get the idea.

07/08/2020, 2:18 pm - +91 73043 57388: So you have retrieved data from JSON?
07/08/2020, 2:19 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): @917304357388 No, that is server side rendering.
07/08/2020, 2:19 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): The data is retrieved directly from the database.
07/08/2020, 2:20 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Yeah
07/08/2020, 2:20 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): But it is a JSON object that has been returned from the DB
07/08/2020, 2:20 pm - +91 73043 57388: Your are dynamically creating a HTML element?

Actually I was thinking about that exactly

Is it possible to dynamically create DIV element for each JSON object retrieved?

11/08/2020, 7:18 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Google is promoting other languages only because Oracle acquired Java,and maybe thats the reason why there is widespread hate for itüò±
11/08/2020, 7:36 pm - +91 98337 26449: Then why does Google foobar only take submissions is java or python?
11/08/2020, 7:37 pm - +91 98337 26449: *in
11/08/2020, 8:21 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Google Foobar is rumoured to be a recruitment strategy of the past. It's still present as a challenge, but I've read that they've stopped recruiting through that.
11/08/2020, 8:23 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Oh
11/08/2020, 8:23 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Maybe because its very popular and easy to learn
11/08/2020, 8:26 pm - +91 98337 26449: It still puts you in their radar. Or else they would've completely canned it.
11/08/2020, 8:26 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Yeah maybe.
11/08/2020, 8:56 pm - +91 77385 57601: Google is shifting from java because it have some licensing issues
11/08/2020, 8:57 pm - +91 82916 21138: Yeah I heard this too
11/08/2020, 8:58 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): It was a stupid move by Oracle imo. They're killing off Java...
11/08/2020, 8:59 pm - +91 77385 57601: And Flutter can never replace native...it is true google is try to push kotlin through it.
11/08/2020, 9:02 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Yes
11/08/2020, 9:03 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): But the fuchsia OS will be totally flutter based right!?
11/08/2020, 9:08 pm - +91 77385 57601: Will it be able to take over most popular OS?
11/08/2020, 9:10 pm - +91 82916 21138: ü§î interesting question tbh maybe I heard they are filling all gaps of android and making it
11/08/2020, 9:12 pm - +91 77385 57601: I have already told this but think of replacing millions of android devices
11/08/2020, 9:20 pm - +91 82916 21138: Yeah  it will be gradual process but still üòÖ maybe fuchsia becomes new update of android and from there on things change or something like that ü§î
11/08/2020, 9:20 pm - +91 82916 21138: Like android has already started removing some stuff
11/08/2020, 9:21 pm - +91 77385 57601: This can never happen...
11/08/2020, 9:21 pm - +91 82916 21138: Yeah ik
11/08/2020, 9:22 pm - +91 82916 21138: I mean android is changing although so maybe idk who knows the future üòÖ

11/08/2020, 9:23 pm - +91 77385 57601: Changing a os means bye bye to your data
11/08/2020, 9:23 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Yes

11/08/2020, 9:25 pm - +91 77385 57601: No not gonna happen
11/08/2020, 9:25 pm - +91 82916 21138: Like and Android's last version might look similar to Fuchsian maybe  kind of like that so smooth switch ü§î
11/08/2020, 9:25 pm - +91 77385 57601: Leaving support for millions of devices is not simple and thing they can do as a company
11/08/2020, 9:25 pm - +91 82916 21138: True
11/08/2020, 9:26 pm - +91 82916 21138: ü§î yeah true thing but what I read is that they are planning to make something which all iot device etc can use etc so don't know
11/08/2020, 9:27 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Kaha se aate aise idea?
11/08/2020, 9:27 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Most definately not.
11/08/2020, 9:27 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): You can change you OS without loosing your data.
11/08/2020, 9:27 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): As long as it is implemented properly.
11/08/2020, 9:27 pm - +91 77385 57601: If I flash a custom rom for it's recommended for a clean flash
11/08/2020, 9:28 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): **recommended**
11/08/2020, 9:29 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): And that is because they don't know what your previous OS was.
11/08/2020, 9:29 pm - +91 77385 57601: Yaa i tried not to and it gave me errors while boot so i did a clean flash
11/08/2020, 9:29 pm - +91 77385 57601: 9 to 10 and the stock was released on 9
11/08/2020, 9:30 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): If you know which OS the phone is running, and you have can push (signed) OTA updates, you can do almost anything.
11/08/2020, 9:30 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Again, this is a custom rom.
11/08/2020, 9:30 pm - +91 77385 57601: Don't you think fuchsia will have totally different file structure and permissions?
11/08/2020, 9:31 pm - +91 82916 21138: ü§î maybe true
11/08/2020, 9:32 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Yes can be
11/08/2020, 9:32 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Even if they do, it is trivial to copy over all data from the old locations to the new one.
11/08/2020, 9:32 pm - +91 77385 57601: App data?
11/08/2020, 9:32 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Fuchsia won't be Linux based right?
11/08/2020, 9:32 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Now app data, I agree, will be quite difficult to port.
11/08/2020, 9:33 pm - +91 77385 57601: And will OEMs will do itüòÇü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

11/08/2020, 9:49 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Did you lose all app data?
11/08/2020, 9:50 pm - +91 99693 94098: Android 10 has scoped storage so you can't directly shift data

13/08/2020, 10:26 am - Farhan Irani (TSEC IT, SE): *ALGO TALKS* by *INFINITE LOOP* 

Algo Talks is a weekly learning series. Each Sunday we take one major topic ranging from graphs to dynamic programming and we go LIVE to solve a bunch of curated problems aimed to better our understanding about those topics. üë®üèª‚Äçüíªüë©üèª‚Äçüíª

Interviews can be intimidating, DP, Graphs, Trees, maths all at once can be daunting. 

We won't rush, we attack each topic one by one, week by week, we will keep solving and keep answering till we all get it right. This is the boost you ever needed to kick-start your DSA journey!

13/08/2020, 11:51 am - Shubham Chettiar (TSEC CS, TE): Guys, 
Suppose I have a US based server hosting my website. Now I wanna get a storage service for my website (Amazon S3)
Would it be better if I get a US based storage or an indian one?
13/08/2020, 11:53 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Not enough details.
13/08/2020, 11:54 am - Shubham Chettiar (TSEC CS, TE): What do you need?
13/08/2020, 11:57 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Details.
13/08/2020, 12:00 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Lmao
13/08/2020, 12:01 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Elaborate on what details you need Kartikkkk
13/08/2020, 12:01 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): üòÇ
13/08/2020, 12:02 pm - Shubham Chettiar (TSEC CS, TE): What details?üòÇ

Alright, so it's a django based website
So I need the storage to upload images from the admin panel and display it to the users 
So I was thinking whether it'll be better if I had an indian based storage since the users are from india
13/08/2020, 12:03 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): *THESE* details.
13/08/2020, 12:04 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): So why is the website hosted in the US?
13/08/2020, 12:04 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Won't the AWS CDN handle that?
13/08/2020, 12:04 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Django ü§©

13/08/2020, 12:05 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): A cdn is a Content *Delivery* Network.
13/08/2020, 12:05 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Yeah, but it can cache stuff, so it won't have to keep fetching stuff from the US, right?

13/08/2020, 2:20 pm - +91 75078 05454: üòÇ it's difficult to make that library work with gcc. You have to get a ported version and then link the library while compiling. Even then the things that can be drawn with that library make you feel like you have time travelled to 2009 üòÇ
13/08/2020, 2:27 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): I really dk why such stuff is being taught to us, instead theu could teach Graphics in Python/Java
13/08/2020, 2:28 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): C/C++ is used for system programming
13/08/2020, 2:29 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Do you know how Graphics are drawn in Python/Java?
13/08/2020, 2:29 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): It ultimately falls back to C/C++
13/08/2020, 2:29 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Would like to üòõ
13/08/2020, 2:29 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): By converting in C/C++
13/08/2020, 2:29 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Hai na?
13/08/2020, 2:29 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): But thats dead imo
13/08/2020, 2:29 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Why would we do that work? libraries hai na Java/Python mai
13/08/2020, 2:29 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Nah bro
Even paint and all built using C/C++
I heard
13/08/2020, 2:30 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): How do you think Python Was built ?
13/08/2020, 2:30 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Ha but do we really have to rebuild the wheelü§î
13/08/2020, 2:30 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Yes bro C/C++ are base of all languages I understand
13/08/2020, 2:31 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): No, but you should understand how the wheel works.
13/08/2020, 2:31 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): It's for those who want it get into Graphics 
Suppose Game Dev me bhi
If you see the Game Engines are also built using C+++
13/08/2020, 2:31 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): True but....turbo C++ use karna zaroori hai uske liyeüòÇ
13/08/2020, 2:31 pm - +91 75078 05454: we should be learning 3d graphics using opengl or something
13/08/2020, 2:31 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): C++
13/08/2020, 2:32 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): That I agree with.
13/08/2020, 2:32 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): C#
13/08/2020, 2:32 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Yeah
13/08/2020, 2:32 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): But after basic graphics.
13/08/2020, 2:32 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): graphics.h is obsolete right?
13/08/2020, 2:32 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): We use C# while building games
But
The actual Engine 
Unity is built using C++

13/08/2020, 2:33 pm - +91 75078 05454: something like this
13/08/2020, 2:33 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Oh wow
13/08/2020, 2:33 pm - +91 97739 65140: *unreal
13/08/2020, 2:33 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Will search more about these
13/08/2020, 2:33 pm - +91 77385 57601: @918080142783 if they are doing graphics cpp and their libraries are old then how morden languages are using it?
13/08/2020, 2:34 pm - +91 77385 57601: Like are they modifying it or something else?
13/08/2020, 2:34 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Again, graphics.h is depricated because modern processors support SIMD.
13/08/2020, 2:34 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Or calling its methods internally
13/08/2020, 2:34 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Oh
13/08/2020, 2:34 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): SIMD is Single Instruction, Multiple Data.
13/08/2020, 2:35 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): So if you want to add/multiply 4 sets of numbers then you can do it in 1 operation.
13/08/2020, 2:35 pm - +91 77385 57601: So the languages are using this and we are learning graphics.h?ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

13/08/2020, 2:35 pm - +91 77385 57601: Okk
13/08/2020, 2:35 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): This effectively increases the speed by 4x.
13/08/2020, 2:35 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): MU doing MU things
13/08/2020, 2:35 pm - +91 75078 05454: oh

13/08/2020, 2:36 pm - +91 77385 57601: Haa but I just asking this
13/08/2020, 2:36 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): It is easier to understand SIMD once you know what the hell you are actually doing with the data.
13/08/2020, 2:36 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Ooh
13/08/2020, 2:36 pm - +91 77385 57601: But sometimes you can skip bicycleüòÅ

13/08/2020, 2:43 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): And just went with whatever interested me at that time.

120 CS + 120 IT + 60 Extc + 60 Biomedical + 60 BioTech + 60 Chemical = 480
.¬∞.Total number of students in all 4 years=480*4=1920(minimum no of students) 
Tution fees per sem = 129545
Consider in worst case 50% students as OBC/EBC
No of obc/ebc students=960
.¬∞.Rem students=960
Total revenue (in form of tution fees) by obc/ebc students= 960*129545*0.5 =62181600
Total revenue (in form of tution fees) by regular students= 960*129545=124,363,200
Total tution fees gained per year = 186,544,800
Total college development feea gained per year = 1920*12955 = 24,873,600

Total income of college per year(worst case) = 186544800+24873600 = 211,418,400 = 21.14Cr

Now with such an amount of income considering the fees to be given to teachers,other staffs,electricity bill and cost of devices,etc..still there must be a decent amount of money left with the authority, where that goes!!!!!!

24/08/2020, 3:12 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): My opinion:

Do everything yourself, college is mostly useless.

Do DBMS and DSA yourself, they are really important.
DSA: Please code things out yourself. Try to code out all the DS and their types yourself. DSA Sorting: GFG has short vids on all sorts on YT. They are your bible.

Imp vid: SQL and ER diags: https://youtu.be/HXV3zeQKqGY

Do a small crash course on core Java. It's moderately important. Please don't go for any long course.

PCE is just mugging up.

What is comp. prog. fundas!? We didn't have that. Idr what we had in place of that lol
24/08/2020, 3:14 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): DSA should we learn only in C or other languages as well?
24/08/2020, 3:14 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): My opinion: Do everything from YT. Don't take any courses, even if they are free.
24/08/2020, 3:14 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): C for now.

24/08/2020, 3:21 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): My opinion:

DSA: PLEASE code things yourself. If you want to refer to a book, not required of you've paid attention in class, 'DS and algo in C'.

DBMS: Do the SQL vid that I shared. I would not recommend a book. Use Techmax.

26/08/2020, 12:11 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Noooooo ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
26/08/2020, 12:11 pm - +91 97681 67131: So last resort hackintosh... though driver support is pathetic üòÇ
26/08/2020, 12:11 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): You have completely missed the point.
26/08/2020, 12:11 pm - +91 77385 57601: Yes as Microsoft is also pushing arm now
26/08/2020, 12:11 pm - +91 97681 67131: Nope I guess they might just have it I was watching WWDC 2020 Rosetta 2 seems promising
26/08/2020, 12:12 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Pushing arm is not the issue.
(Arm actually has better performance for lower price)
26/08/2020, 12:12 pm - +91 97681 67131: They can‚Äôt make it happen for that u need control over hardware as well
26/08/2020, 12:12 pm - +91 97681 67131: They failed once remember snapdragon 835 laptop
26/08/2020, 12:12 pm - +91 88284 70904: Mai sublime mai likha kuch bola nahi lolüòÇ
26/08/2020, 12:12 pm - Pranav Dani: And lower thermals
26/08/2020, 12:13 pm - +91 97681 67131: Windows ka some hp or Lenovo built in 2018 ig
26/08/2020, 12:13 pm - +91 77385 57601: They are partnering with Qualcomm for chipset and supporting them
26/08/2020, 12:13 pm - Pranav Dani: Doesn't mean always
26/08/2020, 12:13 pm - +91 77385 57601: +1
26/08/2020, 12:13 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): The only reason big companies (Adobe/Autodesk) write hight performance software for Macs is because it is 99% similiar to Windows.
26/08/2020, 12:13 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): So the extra effort is justified.
26/08/2020, 12:14 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): (And almost negligible)
26/08/2020, 12:14 pm - +91 77385 57601: After foldable from Microsoft i think they will do it
26/08/2020, 12:14 pm - +91 97681 67131: I know I read that now issue is they are different companies after all so how things work out is interesting also interesting is to see what amd and intel have in stock...
26/08/2020, 12:15 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): But if Windows and Mac instruction sets diverge, then most software will either stop supporting mac, or will use the automatice translation tools and take a huge performance hit.
26/08/2020, 12:15 pm - Pranav Dani: Amd is beating intel with ryzen for now in most places at lower costs
26/08/2020, 12:15 pm - +91 77385 57601: Yes because intel n amd will suffer the most
26/08/2020, 12:15 pm - +91 97681 67131: True agreed but I know if someone in the industry can make such big changes though foolish and work for them in their favour it‚Äôs got to be Apple...
26/08/2020, 12:15 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Not every time.
26/08/2020, 12:16 pm - +91 77385 57601: True but will developer take enough efforts?
26/08/2020, 12:16 pm - Pranav Dani: They have given transition period for now and pro stuff stays on intel for now
26/08/2020, 12:16 pm - Pranav Dani: So we have to see what happens
26/08/2020, 12:16 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Adobe does NOT support the latest Mac Pro or the ludicrously expensive "Pro display".
26/08/2020, 12:16 pm - +91 97681 67131: Ya that‚Äôs the catch Mac app support in App Store isn‚Äôt gr8 anyway, with arm chips Apple can bring mobile developers as in iPad OS and iOS developers to develop as well
26/08/2020, 12:17 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Yes, but that will be throwing away like 35+ YEARS of desktop developers.
26/08/2020, 12:17 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Imagine the knowledge and experience.
26/08/2020, 12:17 pm - +91 97681 67131: Yes üòÇüòÇ
26/08/2020, 12:18 pm - Pranav Dani: Not exactly
26/08/2020, 12:18 pm - +91 97681 67131: I agree but I feel they can pull this one off...
26/08/2020, 12:19 pm - +91 97681 67131: Plus they aren‚Äôt throwing anything to trash Rosetta 2 is helping not arm optimised apps to run at least
26/08/2020, 12:19 pm - +91 77385 57601: Do u know how irritating it is to develop a UI for different screen sizeü•∫
26/08/2020, 12:20 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Forget UI, do you know how irritating it is to optimize for a different INSTRUCTION SET?
26/08/2020, 12:20 pm - +91 97681 67131: Ig they will Microsoft already had office ready on WWDC 2020 announced day to run on Mac so... Also it‚Äôs Apple a trillion dollar market cap company they can make it happen...
26/08/2020, 12:20 pm - +91 77385 57601: Never did thatüòÇüòÖ
26/08/2020, 12:21 pm - +91 77385 57601: It will take a loooonng time
26/08/2020, 12:21 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Even today, most server software has two versions: Windows (semi-supported) and Linux.
26/08/2020, 12:21 pm - +91 97681 67131: That‚Äôs the catch, since Apple has selected number of products which often use same screen sizes say like se 2020 which is iPhone 6 ka screen only so it‚Äôs much easier for them...
26/08/2020, 12:22 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): MariaDB straight up has this warning: If you compile this on Mac, then anything that happens is your problem.
26/08/2020, 12:22 pm - +91 97681 67131: They themselves mention 2 yrs transition time.. let‚Äôs see üòÇüòÇ
26/08/2020, 12:22 pm - +91 97681 67131: Ya Agreed
26/08/2020, 12:23 pm - +91 77385 57601: Who will install mac for serverüòÇ
26/08/2020, 12:23 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): No, they mean even for development.
26/08/2020, 12:24 pm - +91 77385 57601: Ohh
26/08/2020, 12:24 pm - +91 97681 67131: Let‚Äôs see what pans out for the future of intel and amd specially cause that‚Äôs most interesting to me if this plan succeeds.... They won‚Äôt go without a fight it‚Äôs sure...
26/08/2020, 12:24 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Oh they are not going anywhere.
26/08/2020, 12:24 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): one question:
why are most servers linux based?
26/08/2020, 12:24 pm - +91 77385 57601: Apple n EpicüòÇüòÇ
26/08/2020, 12:24 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Even if all consumer products switch to arm, legacy servers will still need maintainence.
26/08/2020, 12:24 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): @918080142783
26/08/2020, 12:24 pm - +91 77385 57601: I think Epic will win
26/08/2020, 12:24 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): And don't forget mainframes.
26/08/2020, 12:25 pm - +91 97681 67131: I know but they might have to market their product differently or themselves make arm chips if Apple and Microsoft can pull arm transition off
26/08/2020, 12:25 pm - +91 97681 67131: Open source so lot of libraries available
26/08/2020, 12:25 pm - +91 97681 67131: Natively
26/08/2020, 12:25 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Two reasons:
- No licensing issues
- Raw performance.
26/08/2020, 12:26 pm - +91 97681 67131: Ya also performance...
26/08/2020, 12:26 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): And the performance part comes from being open source.
26/08/2020, 12:27 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): So if you don't want a network driver (for whatever reason), simply delete the code for networking and suddenly you have the best performing kernal for your application.
26/08/2020, 12:27 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): ok yeah open source
26/08/2020, 12:27 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): quick bug fuxes
26/08/2020, 12:29 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): And you can fix a bug yourself if needed.
26/08/2020, 12:29 pm - +91 97681 67131: Ya this is the main reason lot of restrictions in Windows especially OSX for this üòÇ
26/08/2020, 12:29 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): ha
26/08/2020, 12:30 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Oh yes.
26/08/2020, 12:30 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): The source code of Windows has been leaked once or twice but I don't think anyone was able to compile it.
26/08/2020, 12:30 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): wow
26/08/2020, 12:31 pm - +91 97681 67131: Wow when??
26/08/2020, 12:31 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): I don't remember exactly, but not too long ago.
26/08/2020, 12:31 pm - +91 97681 67131: Ya I remember even Xbox source code was leaked
26/08/2020, 12:33 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): compile it?why not?
26/08/2020, 12:37 pm - +91 77385 57601: Ig whole source codes were never leaked
26/08/2020, 12:41 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Maybe ~3 years?
26/08/2020, 12:41 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Who is in C1?
26/08/2020, 12:42 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): You have a Maths lecture with Indrajit Sir at 1pm?

I wanted to ask how is Sakshi ma'am ?
Is she like very strict or accepts humor??.

Today I got caught into a situation üòÖüòÖüòÖ
26/08/2020, 5:01 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Sort of...
26/08/2020, 5:03 pm - +91 98337 47258: She's one of the best teachers actually
She can be a little strict, especially in physical lecs but ya she's good
26/08/2020, 5:03 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Thanks
I too felt she's the best.
26/08/2020, 5:03 pm - +91 98337 47258: She's been very fast in online lecs but in physical lecs you wouldn't wanna miss her lecs
26/08/2020, 5:04 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Someone else was saying some dialogue üòÖüòÇ
And I ended up speaking something at the same time
And maam ko laga maine bola üòÖ

26/08/2020, 5:07 pm - +91 98337 47258: And if you see SSS ma'am, just hide your face and run away
26/08/2020, 5:07 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Who is SSS?
26/08/2020, 5:07 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): > Anagha maam

What do you mean by best teacher?
26/08/2020, 5:07 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): In all her lectures, all she has done is read from the ppt.
26/08/2020, 5:07 pm - +91 98337 47258: We had her in SE too
But sem 4, i don't remember if sem 3
26/08/2020, 5:07 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): ??
26/08/2020, 5:07 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Like literally read out the slide line by line.
26/08/2020, 5:08 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Reminds me of Primary school teachers üòÖ
26/08/2020, 5:08 pm - +91 98337 47258: Just a teacher most of the students avoid
26/08/2020, 5:08 pm - +91 98337 47258: And still do ig
26/08/2020, 5:08 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): And she also gave use some gems like:
"When you switch on the voltage of the current ..."
26/08/2020, 5:09 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): She forced some ppl to switch their web cams on
26/08/2020, 5:09 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): That was boss moment üòÇ
26/08/2020, 5:09 pm - +91 98337 47258: Yaa
She did here too
But she mentioned it was all new for her and it would make her comfortable seeing faces
So that's understandable
26/08/2020, 5:09 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Also, electron energy gets converted to visual energy.
26/08/2020, 5:10 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Yeah thats cool actually
26/08/2020, 5:11 pm - +91 98337 47258: We have her too but I just log in and move away
26/08/2020, 5:15 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Full form?
26/08/2020, 5:16 pm - +91 98337 47258: For SSS?
26/08/2020, 5:16 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Yes
26/08/2020, 5:17 pm - +91 98337 47258: Sonal ma'am ig ,not so sure
Had her in previous two sems
I just called her SSS
26/08/2020, 5:17 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Sonal Shroff?
26/08/2020, 5:17 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): She is a nice teacher.
26/08/2020, 5:17 pm - +91 98337 47258: Yaa
26/08/2020, 5:17 pm - +91 98337 47258: Umm, not really
She won't have a civil discussion
Her physical lecs seemed horrible

27/08/2020, 6:22 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): But a VERY big red flag for almost anything related to computers is when the same input gives you different outputs.
27/08/2020, 6:23 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): So if running the same program twice with the same input gives different answers then something has gone horribly wrong.
27/08/2020, 6:28 pm - Hardik Raheja (TSEC, CS): The entire reason chaos theory came into being is that a computer gave out different outputs. Read a little about it. It's a different case but an interesting read

03/09/2020, 12:48 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): No.
03/09/2020, 12:48 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): .
03/09/2020, 12:51 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): It's to clear the channel.
The previous input ka enter is still in the channel
And if I don't give
s.nextLine();
 Before the string input 
Vo enter gets stored in the string ka variable 

So isliye 
To avoid that.

03/09/2020, 12:51 pm - +91 97027 35002: Just remember to this whenever you take a interger etc input before taking string input
03/09/2020, 12:51 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): No.
03/09/2020, 12:52 pm - +91 97027 35002: Integer*
03/09/2020, 12:52 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Again, no.
03/09/2020, 12:52 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): There's another workaround to this too 
Which is buffer flush or something 
But I am lazy so nextLine():
Se kar leta hai
03/09/2020, 12:52 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): OK listen.
03/09/2020, 12:52 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Ok sir.
03/09/2020, 12:52 pm - +91 77385 57601: Ab khatamüòÇ
03/09/2020, 12:53 pm - +91 97027 35002: Idt java me there is something like flushall()
03/09/2020, 12:53 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Scanner operates on a token stream, as opposed to BufferedReader, which operates on lines.
03/09/2020, 12:54 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): So, imagine Scanner gets the inputs:
```10\nHello, World!\n```
03/09/2020, 12:54 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Didn't see the code
03/09/2020, 12:54 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Yes ik
03/09/2020, 12:54 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Okay
03/09/2020, 12:55 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Now, it is important to understand what the ```nextInt()``` method actually does.
03/09/2020, 12:55 pm - +91 97027 35002: Explain sir
03/09/2020, 12:55 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): ```nextInt()``` will try to find an *Integer token*, while ignoring any whitespace.
03/09/2020, 12:56 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): An Integer token is defined as ```/(+|-)?\d+/```
03/09/2020, 12:56 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Meaning + or -, followed by one or more digits.
03/09/2020, 12:57 pm - +91 97027 35002: Okay
03/09/2020, 12:57 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): So Scanner reads the token stream, finds 10 and returns it.
03/09/2020, 12:57 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Now the stream is: ```\nHello, World!\n```
03/09/2020, 12:58 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Again, we must understand what the ```nextLine()``` method does.
03/09/2020, 12:59 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): ```nextLine()``` is actually a special method, that breaks the boundries of a tokenizer.
03/09/2020, 1:00 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): It simply starts reading from the current point, and returns *all characters* till it finds a newline (```\n```).
03/09/2020, 1:00 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): (without the newline)
03/09/2020, 1:01 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): So calling ```nextLine()``` on ```\nHello, World!\n``` will start reading, the stop at the first character because it is a newline.
03/09/2020, 1:01 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): So basically 
It returned nothing in my case
03/09/2020, 1:01 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Which means it will return an empty string.
03/09/2020, 1:01 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Yes.
03/09/2020, 1:02 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Alright. 
Got it.
Thank you.
03/09/2020, 1:02 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): No problem.
03/09/2020, 1:02 pm - +91 97027 35002: Ohhhhh
03/09/2020, 1:02 pm - +91 97027 35002: Okayyy

Collaboration of 2 committees really helps an event grow bigger, ACM sets up the events, E-Cell and it's connections help with perks and opportunities like paid internships. I wonder if we could do something like this in our college?

11/09/2020, 9:52 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Guys, we figured Flutter installation and  setup might be quite a task.
So we have a pre recorded video just so that you can set up your systems for Flutter Development. 

Here's the video:
https://bit.ly/flutter_installation

Go through it
And follow it.
If you face any issues while installation, hit me up,
I'll help you out!
11/09/2020, 9:53 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Cool will
11/09/2020, 10:35 am - Tushar Nankani: Hi everyone! 

Just a request to all of you, if you see your classmates, your friends, or even acquaintances, coming up with content/ideas/YouTube videos/Instagram influencer, it's very new for them, and if you find even one thing good/creative/informative/entertained:

_Never hesitate and go ahead and message and appreciate them!_  

(Ego might be a problem here sometimes, but it won't help anyone except the ego itself XD)

It would mean so much to them, you have no idea! 

It would really, really boost their confidence, by your words! üôåüèª

11/09/2020, 10:56 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Yes 
I'll tell you what
I have this one principle:
If you are interested in something, learn it
If you are not interested in something, learn only so much 
That someone else can't rip you off.

Like you must be smart enough to understand whether something is good/bad for you

Also must seek guidance of that person who knows about it and you trust them.

        {
            x=10;
        }
        System.out.println(x);

12/09/2020, 9:14 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): It will fucking work for all languages
But not Java

Java, while compiling check what if all the cases fail?

I am NEVER going to give a garbage error like C or C++
12/09/2020, 9:14 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): they have to fix thus lmao
12/09/2020, 9:14 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Garbage Value**

12/09/2020, 9:14 pm - +91 99693 94098: The compiler doesn't know if the condition will be satisfied till it executes it. So it just assumes that it will not enter if at all
12/09/2020, 9:14 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): garbage values in C/C++
12/09/2020, 9:14 pm - +91 97681 67131: Is it cause by Default java mai variables aren't initialized??

12/09/2020, 9:15 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Interestingly

If suppose go 2 class method

and try to access it using an object
It will work
12/09/2020, 9:16 pm - +91 97694 89970: If main method ke andar hai na. It's declared inside method so still it is a local variable
12/09/2020, 9:16 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Because of Natkhat Default constructor
12/09/2020, 9:16 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): üòÇ

This looks like really very easy but it blew my mind when I got to know what is happening actually behind the scenes. 
This one is really interesting ;)

13/09/2020, 4:44 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): If you are adding 3
It would not give 130
Because range hi nahi hai
13/09/2020, 4:45 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): But kya output aayega lemme try to figure out

13/09/2020, 11:16 am - +91 77385 57601: Cpp mein = chalta hai ig
13/09/2020, 11:16 am - +91 97739 65140: Simple hint is think about precedence and prefix expression
13/09/2020, 11:17 am - +91 97739 65140: Yes, but why??
13/09/2020, 11:17 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Oh
13/09/2020, 11:17 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Got it
13/09/2020, 11:17 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Wait
13/09/2020, 11:17 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Pehle a = True hua
13/09/2020, 11:17 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): That executes
13/09/2020, 11:17 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Theek hai
13/09/2020, 11:18 am - +91 97739 65140: no, it doesn't give error. This is valid in java, only if you put it in if then will it give an error
13/09/2020, 11:18 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Then we have or
13/09/2020, 11:18 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Any thing or with true is true
13/09/2020, 11:18 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): So 
Baki 2 exp don't get executed
13/09/2020, 11:18 am - +91 91725 67828: Yes
13/09/2020, 11:18 am - +91 97739 65140: yes, but kya bhai??
Ideally nhi shona chahiye
13/09/2020, 11:18 am - +91 97739 65140: *hona
13/09/2020, 11:19 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Brackets phele hona chaiye right?
Saare
13/09/2020, 11:19 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Ideally
13/09/2020, 11:19 am - +91 97739 65140: this is what is happening but think in terms of precedence, this should not happen
13/09/2020, 11:19 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Yes got you
13/09/2020, 11:20 am - Tushar Nankani: boolean a=false,b=false,c=false,x=false;
        x = ((a = true) || (b = true) && (c = true));
        System.out.print (a + "," + b + ", " + c);
13/09/2020, 11:20 am - Tushar Nankani: What about this?
13/09/2020, 11:20 am - +91 97739 65140: still it should give true, false, false
13/09/2020, 11:21 am - +91 97739 65140: If you want to understand the logic, think in terms of prefix expression
13/09/2020, 11:21 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): @919773965140 
Aisi cheeze bhej te raho
13/09/2020, 11:21 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Massssst hai
13/09/2020, 11:22 am - +91 97739 65140: üòÇ
13/09/2020, 11:24 am - +91 97739 65140: If anyone of you don't get it, then I will explain
13/09/2020, 11:24 am - +91 97739 65140: what's happening here
13/09/2020, 11:25 am - +91 88284 70904: I understood the false false scenario coz it‚Äôs happening due to precedence
13/09/2020, 11:26 am - +91 88284 70904: But the first true ka m not getting
13/09/2020, 11:27 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): -126?
13/09/2020, 11:27 am - +91 97694 89970: Yes correct :)
13/09/2020, 11:28 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Damn how?
13/09/2020, 11:28 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): I mean System.out.println() is an overloaded method
13/09/2020, 11:29 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): It supports all data types if Im not wrongüòÖ
13/09/2020, 11:29 am - +91 97739 65140: x+y is an int
13/09/2020, 11:29 am - +91 97739 65140: Not byte
13/09/2020, 11:29 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Accha waise
13/09/2020, 11:29 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Oh F ha
13/09/2020, 11:29 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): ShittüòÇ
13/09/2020, 11:29 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): I've never used byte till nowüòÇ
13/09/2020, 11:30 am - +91 97739 65140: Wait till you see the magic of Strings in JavaüòÇ
13/09/2020, 11:30 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): But, I still don't get how?
13/09/2020, 11:30 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): ?
13/09/2020, 11:30 am - +91 77385 57601: Strings sab language ka ajeeb he lagta haiüòÖ
13/09/2020, 11:30 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Strings in Java are cool
13/09/2020, 11:30 am - +91 97739 65140: üòÇüòÇüòÇ
13/09/2020, 11:31 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Nah C/C++ ke sabse ajeb hai
13/09/2020, 11:31 am - +91 97739 65140: smallest storage register size is integer not byte
13/09/2020, 11:31 am - +91 97739 65140: So, anything smaller than int if you operate them it will always result in int
13/09/2020, 11:31 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Okay  
But you declared them as byte ba?
13/09/2020, 11:32 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Na*
13/09/2020, 11:32 am - +91 97739 65140: .
13/09/2020, 11:32 am - +91 97739 65140: This rule holds
13/09/2020, 11:32 am - +91 97694 89970: If we apply any arithmetic operator between two variables a and b, then the result type is always *max(int , type of a, type of b)*
13/09/2020, 11:32 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Oh okay
13/09/2020, 11:32 am - +91 97739 65140: üëçüèªüî•üî•
13/09/2020, 11:33 am - +91 97739 65140: Bro, in this if you know how expressions are executed
You will know we make prefix expression
13/09/2020, 11:33 am - +91 82916 21138: True,false ,false cause left to right Jayega I guess
13/09/2020, 11:34 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): ‚úÖ
13/09/2020, 11:34 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): This ik
13/09/2020, 11:34 am - +91 82916 21138: I had seen this question in my tenth prelims üòÇ
13/09/2020, 11:36 am - +91 97694 89970: c ka false kaise aaya?
I'm getting true false true ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
13/09/2020, 11:36 am - +91 97739 65140: In this case prefix expression is :

||=aTrue&&=bTrue=cTrue


So, here || will operate on =aTrue first as if that is true then it need not go to right
13/09/2020, 11:37 am - +91 97739 65140: Bro, in simple words || is a short circuiting operator
13/09/2020, 11:37 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Yess
13/09/2020, 11:38 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): This is short circuit operators ka magic
13/09/2020, 11:38 am - +91 97739 65140: So, if you have a||b,
If a is true, it doesn't operate b
13/09/2020, 11:38 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): üôèüôè
13/09/2020, 11:38 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Yes
13/09/2020, 11:38 am - +91 97739 65140: *execute b
13/09/2020, 11:38 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Damn Ive forgotten the basics
13/09/2020, 11:38 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): ^
13/09/2020, 11:39 am - +91 97739 65140: Yes
13/09/2020, 11:39 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Aur bhejo aiseüòÇ
13/09/2020, 11:39 am - +91 97739 65140: Damn, your school op
13/09/2020, 11:39 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): True
13/09/2020, 11:39 am - +91 97739 65140: Sure
13/09/2020, 11:39 am - +91 88284 70904: Bhai kya!!!????üòÇ
13/09/2020, 11:40 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Damn our school set really dirty questions but is level tak nahi gaye hai
13/09/2020, 11:40 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Yeah
13/09/2020, 11:41 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): üëç
13/09/2020, 11:41 am - +91 97694 89970: Haa yeh barabar... Uske baad a= true aur b=false rahega. And then c ka?
&& ke pehle wala expression true hai par abhi aage bhi we have to check na?
13/09/2020, 11:42 am - +91 97739 65140: bro
13/09/2020, 11:43 am - +91 97739 65140: check this
13/09/2020, 11:43 am - +91 97739 65140: since || is the first operation here , it will short circuit . Had there been any other operation , it would have worked differently
13/09/2020, 11:44 am - +91 97694 89970: Areyyy. Haa got it got it üôà
13/09/2020, 11:44 am - +91 77385 57601: Ye abhi bhi nhi smajha
13/09/2020, 11:44 am - +91 97739 65140: bro this is how computer evaluates your expressions
13/09/2020, 11:45 am - +91 97739 65140: sem 3 mein padhate hai in application of stacks
13/09/2020, 11:45 am - +91 97694 89970: Ahh. See yahi hua üòåüòÇ
13/09/2020, 11:45 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): To swap two variables without a third one,this works in Java ig:
b= a+b - (a=b)
13/09/2020, 11:45 am - +91 97739 65140: prefix and postfix notation
13/09/2020, 11:46 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Abhi chal rha hai yeh
13/09/2020, 11:47 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): <Media omitted>
13/09/2020, 11:47 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Even the concept is very interesting
13/09/2020, 11:47 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Mujhe ghanta kuch samja nahi ye
13/09/2020, 11:48 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): @919773965140 
How do I even attempt this üòÇ
13/09/2020, 11:48 am - +91 97739 65140: bro, wait
13/09/2020, 11:48 am - +91 97739 65140: I am still on this
13/09/2020, 11:48 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Okok
13/09/2020, 11:49 am - +91 97739 65140: I guess this should work , but only if it is int, float, double.
You can't do this for others
13/09/2020, 11:49 am - +91 98206 14506: Woah cool!
13/09/2020, 11:50 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Oh
13/09/2020, 11:50 am - +91 91725 67828: x = (a = true) || *(*(b = true) && (c = true) *)*;
      
Precedence ki wajese you'll get these extra brackets,
But the associativity is still left to right, so a=true will remain the same
13/09/2020, 11:50 am - +91 82916 21138: Yes
13/09/2020, 11:51 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): <Media omitted>
13/09/2020, 11:51 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Yes it does
13/09/2020, 11:52 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): My mind can't even process this shitüòÇ
13/09/2020, 11:52 am - +91 97694 89970: Woah üëåüèºüî•
13/09/2020, 11:53 am - +91 82916 21138: Yeah this was in 10th too right tanay ?
13/09/2020, 11:53 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): But the most efficient way is using ex-or
13/09/2020, 11:53 am - +91 97739 65140: kya op hai
s=%r;print(s%%s) 
??
13/09/2020, 11:53 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Nope lol,not for me
13/09/2020, 11:53 am - +91 82916 21138: Arrey ü§£ so mere school be muje Bohot mara phir toh üò°ü§¢
13/09/2020, 11:54 am - +91 82916 21138: One more trick question which java developers gets confused doing c is the increment and decrement
13/09/2020, 11:54 am - +91 82916 21138: Cause in java we go left to right but in c it's anything üòÇ
13/09/2020, 11:54 am - +91 97739 65140: very true
13/09/2020, 11:55 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Happy that Java was my first
13/09/2020, 11:55 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): üôèüôè
13/09/2020, 11:55 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): The output is the exact same expression
13/09/2020, 11:55 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Same to same.
13/09/2020, 11:55 am - +91 82916 21138: I had a fight with my professor last sem on a increment and decrement üòÇ while c programming lectures
13/09/2020, 11:55 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Major F
13/09/2020, 11:56 am - +91 82916 21138: Since I was from java background she started telling me you are wrong etc etc and it turned out both were right üòÇ
13/09/2020, 11:56 am - +91 97739 65140: abbey yaar this is python 2 ka format syntax

13/09/2020, 11:56 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Self replicating code
13/09/2020, 11:57 am - +91 97739 65140: so , you have something like print('hi %s bye'%('Dheeraj'))
This is python 2 formatting
13/09/2020, 11:57 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Idk about %r
13/09/2020, 11:57 am - +91 97739 65140: so here he did print(s%s)

13/09/2020, 12:41 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): It is HEAVILY used for data processing.
13/09/2020, 12:50 pm - +91 97694 89970: Ohh yess true. Byte is the best choice if we want to handle data in terms of strings either from the file or from the network. 
I saw the usage of it in Serialization concept.
13/09/2020, 1:51 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Another good question,predict the O/p:
(alert:you need to know a bit of pre-defined non-primitive data types for this and some OOP)

public class Demo{ 
    public static void main(String[] arr){ 
        Integer num1 = 100; 
        Integer num2 = 100; 
        Integer num3 = 500; 
        Integer num4 = 500; 
          
        if(num1==num2){ 
            System.out.println("num1 == num2"); 
        } 
        else{ 
            System.out.println("num1 != num2");

13/09/2020, 1:52 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): nope havent used wrapper fns here
13/09/2020, 1:52 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): I mean Wrapper classes

13/09/2020, 1:53 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): aise nahi
13/09/2020, 1:54 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Choices:

a) num1 == num2

b) num1 == num2
    num3 != num4

    num3 == num4
d) num1 != num2
    num3 != num4
13/09/2020, 1:54 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): So 
num1 != num2
num3 != num4
13/09/2020, 1:54 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): nope
13/09/2020, 1:54 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Okay

13/09/2020, 2:01 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Chal
It is related to range onlt na?
13/09/2020, 2:01 pm - +91 82916 21138: Haa Nahi bolunga
13/09/2020, 2:02 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): closer
13/09/2020, 2:08 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): range is like byte

13/09/2020, 2:13 pm - +91 77385 57601: Mein ese he feka tha
13/09/2020, 2:13 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): If you want to compare objects
equals() use karna chaiye
13/09/2020, 2:13 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Not ==
13/09/2020, 2:13 pm - +91 77385 57601: Haa a reason
13/09/2020, 2:13 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): here is the answer:

Answer: b)num1 == num2
                  num3 != num4
Reason: We always thought that whenever two object references are compared using ‚Äú==‚Äù, it always evaluates to ‚Äúfalse‚Äù. But here Integer caching changes the results.Integer class has a caching range of -128 to 127. Whenever a number is between this range and autoboxing is used, it assigns the same reference. That‚Äôs why for value 100, both num1 and num2 will have the same reference, but for the value 500 (not in the range of -128 to 127), num3 and num4 will have different reference.
13/09/2020, 2:13 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): I knew this for String
13/09/2020, 2:13 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): String ke liye always same location hota hai
13/09/2020, 2:14 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): String pool ki vjh se
13/09/2020, 2:14 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): yesssss
13/09/2020, 2:14 pm - +91 77385 57601: Mereko laga ki jo issue hota hai bade numbers mein hota hai issleye smaller number would be trueüòÇ
13/09/2020, 2:14 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): if you want different String then use String Builder/Buffer

13/09/2020, 3:28 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): @919769489970 
Vo byte wale me bhi yehi hota hai
13/09/2020, 3:29 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Overflow hoke negative side pe gaya
13/09/2020, 3:39 pm - +91 97694 89970: Yes bro. Byte se Int ho jaataa hai woh, phir bcoz of compound assignment operator downcasting or narrowing JVM automatically karta hai jiske karan memory loss hota hai and we get 130 ka in byte as  -126. 

But there's a small catch here, agar b = b + 3 likha hota toh humko error milta tha ;)
13/09/2020, 3:40 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Yes!

13/09/2020, 3:50 pm - +91 97739 65140: Because I know Java Strings
And I have done a lot of ungli with integers in python
13/09/2020, 3:50 pm - +91 97739 65140: Same concept is applied there too
13/09/2020, 3:50 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Oh lol
13/09/2020, 3:50 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): I have not messed much with Python but Java yes

13/09/2020, 6:45 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): > doesnt have argument destructuring

I thought Python does have argument destructuring???
13/09/2020, 6:45 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): @917021825025 What do you mean?
13/09/2020, 6:53 pm - +91 70218 25025: It does but not fully yet, like suppose you have an object or a dictionary with around 10 15 entries but in current context you want to work on just few of them so youd have to write something like 
a = d[key].
But in js or something you can take that key value by saying let { a } = d
13/09/2020, 6:57 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Itn't there a ```**``` operator for things like that?
13/09/2020, 7:13 pm - +91 77385 57601: thats for expo

13/09/2020, 7:13 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): For dictionaries.
13/09/2020, 7:13 pm - +91 77385 57601: okk
13/09/2020, 7:14 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): And also * for lists and tuples.

13/09/2020, 7:40 pm - +91 70218 25025: These spread operators are used to accept variable length arguments, but what im saying is ke when you need only few things, the desturcturing in python gives you everything, you arent able to selectively destructure what you want.
13/09/2020, 7:40 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Yes

13/09/2020, 7:44 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): You can write a method yourself if you reallllly want it.
13/09/2020, 7:48 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Something like:
```def d(dict, *keys):
    values = []
    for k in keys:
        values.append(dict[k])
    
    return values

dict = {"a": 0, "b": 1, "c": 2}
a, c = d(dict, "a", "c")```
13/09/2020, 7:48 pm - +91 70218 25025: Yea most of these small things turn into workarounds.
13/09/2020, 7:57 pm - +91 97694 89970: ... reminds me of var-arg method in java lol. And also have seen this in js in spread and rest operators.

14/09/2020, 12:14 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): The correct way is:
1. Use a "clean" audio clip.
2. Introduce some noise.
3. Remove the noise with different methods.
4. Compare deviation from original waveform.

14/09/2020, 12:17 pm - +91 99693 94098: The dataset is made using 1 and 2
Regarding 3 you can try it out and check for yourself. The model isn't the best out there. It's fast enough for a user to run on colab which provides replicability which is the purpose of the article.
14/09/2020, 12:17 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Print it in this way
14/09/2020, 12:17 pm - +91 99693 94098: I have linked the SEGAN paper if you want. I have linked it in the article as well
14/09/2020, 12:17 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): @918080142783 definitely knows it
14/09/2020, 12:18 pm - +91 99693 94098: GANs will definitely give better results than autoencoders but you can't guarantee replicability with GANs
14/09/2020, 12:19 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): See I am asking if all this is actually worth it?
14/09/2020, 12:20 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Since noise is usually low-amplitude anyways, is there any clear benefit from using an ML model at all.
14/09/2020, 12:21 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): This problem already has an (industy-accepted) solution, so how does your implemetation compare to it?
14/09/2020, 12:22 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): I agree that this is an interesting problem, and any research done here will definately be useful somewhere.
14/09/2020, 12:23 pm - +91 99693 94098: Google is already using it so I guess that speaks for itself
Apart from that, noise is low amplitude is not always true. A car horn isn't of a low amplitude. It might also lead to destructive interference or noise distortion. It's not as easy as using a simple filter to filter out every kind of noise
14/09/2020, 12:23 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): But what I don't like about ML/AI articles is they make it look like a magic silver bullet that can solve all problems.
14/09/2020, 12:24 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): > Google is already using it so I guess that speaks for itself

Hmmm, in what context?
14/09/2020, 12:24 pm - +91 99693 94098: I'm saying this again, the model in the article is not supposed to be the best. It's supposed to be replicable. The implementation is derived from the SEGAN paper (as mentioned in the article also)
14/09/2020, 12:25 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): > A car horn isn't of a low amplitude.

20/09/2020, 11:11 am - Tushar Nankani: I wouldn't mind such initiatives, that would help maintain the gender ratio!

Just that, it's rather sad the score difference is so vast! 


Microsoft already has women in tech, Google has women techmaker's scholarship and so many more opportunities by other firms. There should be more gender neutral opportunities, based upon _skills._


I think, even if they have such opportunities, to maintain the ratio, at least score difference shouldn't be so much. 

It's a debatable topic, and this is purely my point of view.
20/09/2020, 11:13 am - +91 88284 70904: If they r conducting a coding competition then obviously it should purely be on merit and plus they haven‚Äôt specified that it‚Äôs for women only or something. So in this case I think it‚Äôs completely wrong
20/09/2020, 11:14 am - +91 77385 57601: In my opinion if they want to take only a specific gender then only allow them to compete...why to waste others time and make them feel bad of them selfs
20/09/2020, 11:14 am - +91 88284 70904: Exactly

20/09/2020, 11:43 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): 1) You want women empowerment?
--> Conduct women-only hiring drives

2) Don't give false hopes for 1000s of candidates who work hard, score good, expecting they will get a call & then not get selected.

20/09/2020, 12:03 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Agreed, but if it is women-only opportunity, then they should've  mentioned that.
20/09/2020, 12:04 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Exactly
20/09/2020, 12:06 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Pls
20/09/2020, 12:14 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Because the industry should not be male dominated and have equal representation.

(What about the Trans and Queer people though? Do we have opportunities only for them?)
20/09/2020, 12:17 pm - Saket (TSEC, CS): Equal representation won't effect on growth.

20/09/2020, 12:25 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Yeah well they are hired from a pool of female candidates rather than a mixed pool. This def creates an advantage for them to be hired and that is the point of that. Coming to the skills thing, yes there might be differences that will have to patched up later on...
20/09/2020, 12:26 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Well this is just what I think. Feel free to educate me if you think I'm wrong. üëç

20/09/2020, 2:08 pm - +91 98337 26449: The country recovered from genocide mainly because women had the opportunity to take up government roles. And now they have low af corruption. Can you say the same about our country which is lead by men?

20/09/2020, 2:14 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Yeah, this topic is a bit controversial
20/09/2020, 2:14 pm - +91 77385 57601: Opportunities should be given to who are working hard, not because of thier gender. No one had an option to be a male or a female but they have option to work on themselves and be better tomorrow.

20/09/2020, 2:17 pm - +91 98337 26449: Every heard of quotas for underrepresentation? Minority quota? SINDHI QUOTA? Maybe tsec has one? Theres ebc obc all that. It's literally for a fair ground for everyone
20/09/2020, 2:19 pm - +91 77385 57601: This might be the requirement at the time when the laws were written but today this is all political and I don't they are required now.
20/09/2020, 2:20 pm - +91 77385 57601: Think*
20/09/2020, 2:20 pm - +91 98337 26449: That's where you're wrong. Because you can't just undo hundreds of years of underrepresentation.
20/09/2020, 2:20 pm - +91 98337 26449: In a couple of years
20/09/2020, 2:20 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Yeah
20/09/2020, 2:21 pm - +91 98337 26449: If you think that. Please don't become a manager/politician
20/09/2020, 2:21 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): There will be riots
20/09/2020, 2:21 pm - +91 98337 47258: So who says what's been happening is right
Just bcs something happened doesn't mean it's correct, 
People adopted slavery for ages but that doesn't justify it
They were given low opportunities back in the day
If you wanna give quotas, give on the basis on basis on wealth then
20/09/2020, 2:21 pm - +91 98337 26449: Ebc is that
20/09/2020, 2:21 pm - +91 98337 26449: Economically backward
20/09/2020, 2:21 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): We all want reservation only on basis of wealth
20/09/2020, 2:21 pm - +91 98337 47258: Why can't you
They were oppressed at a point. They aren't now
20/09/2020, 2:22 pm - +91 98337 26449: üòÇüòÇüòÇ so all has been undone? Magic? Tada
20/09/2020, 2:22 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): It hurt a lot to see soo many seats go in reserved category
20/09/2020, 2:22 pm - +91 98337 47258: Not in a click
But gradually yeah
There's been a huge change
20/09/2020, 2:22 pm - +91 98337 26449: Just because you aren't getting it it hurts naa? If you did get it you would be happy af
20/09/2020, 2:22 pm - +91 98337 47258: Talking about obc
20/09/2020, 2:22 pm - +91 98337 26449: Think about it from the others perspective for once. Don't be so self absorbed
20/09/2020, 2:22 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Now  its purely on basis of votes
20/09/2020, 2:22 pm - +91 98337 47258: Ik people so damn wealthy getting low grades and qualifying for IIT
20/09/2020, 2:22 pm - +91 98337 26449: Barely. Any change
20/09/2020, 2:23 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): True
20/09/2020, 2:23 pm - +91 77385 57601: Yes
20/09/2020, 2:23 pm - +91 98337 26449: Basically the moral of the story is. You guys are salty because you guys aren't getting it right?
20/09/2020, 2:23 pm - +91 98337 26449: No other reason
20/09/2020, 2:23 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): I mean they need votes ,one who tries to touch the reservation policy gets burned
20/09/2020, 2:23 pm - +91 98337 47258: The truth is
Ones who weren't oppressed ones are the ones getting oppressed , getting low chances just bcs of the term "reserved"
There are equal opportunities for all now
20/09/2020, 2:24 pm - +91 98337 26449: If it was in your favou
20/09/2020, 2:24 pm - +91 98337 26449: You would be happy
20/09/2020, 2:24 pm - +91 98337 26449: *favour
20/09/2020, 2:24 pm - +91 98337 47258: No one goes for a job interview and says you are obc? You can't get it
20/09/2020, 2:24 pm - +91 98337 47258: It used to be there back in the day
20/09/2020, 2:24 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): True
20/09/2020, 2:24 pm - +91 98337 26449: So there's more women than men in Google now? Doubt x
20/09/2020, 2:24 pm - +91 98337 47258: No 
We are salty bcs the undeserving ones get it
20/09/2020, 2:24 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Reservation was meant to be continued only for 10-15 years after independence
20/09/2020, 2:24 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): ++
20/09/2020, 2:25 pm - +91 77385 57601: ++
20/09/2020, 2:25 pm - +91 98337 26449: Exactly. So if you grandparents didn't get a job. That means they were labours. So automatically your father had lower opportunities
20/09/2020, 2:25 pm - +91 98337 26449: Get it?
20/09/2020, 2:25 pm - +91 98337 26449: It's generations
20/09/2020, 2:25 pm - +91 98337 26449: Not just
20/09/2020, 2:25 pm - +91 98337 47258: Nope
More men bcs more men qualified and looked for jobs there
Not bcs they are men
20/09/2020, 2:25 pm - +91 98337 26449: One generation
20/09/2020, 2:25 pm - +91 98337 26449: You think you deserve to be at Google?
20/09/2020, 2:25 pm - +91 98337 26449: All of you?
20/09/2020, 2:26 pm - +91 98337 47258: So go with wealth
If my grandfather was obc 
But I'm rich now
I don't think I should be given an edge
20/09/2020, 2:26 pm - +91 98337 47258: No
Never said that
20/09/2020, 2:26 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): We deserve to have equal opportunities
20/09/2020, 2:26 pm - +91 98337 26449: Because it's been going on for generations. Some didn't even let their daughters study.
20/09/2020, 2:26 pm - +91 77385 57601: Arre jobs ki kon baat kar raha hai we are now talking about quotas
20/09/2020, 2:26 pm - +91 98337 47258: But give to the ones who deserves
20/09/2020, 2:26 pm - +91 98337 26449: So when have you guys been oppressed?
20/09/2020, 2:26 pm - +91 98337 47258: Sir
Things are changing
If you wanna encourage then encourage their studies
Not give away jobs

20/09/2020, 2:27 pm - +91 77385 57601: That was because of mindset of thier parents no one stopped them
20/09/2020, 2:27 pm - +91 98337 47258: Taking away seats
What if I deserved a place
But half were reserved
I lost my place
20/09/2020, 2:27 pm - +91 98337 47258: It's 2020
Not 1920
20/09/2020, 2:28 pm - +91 98337 26449: What if they pass a law tomorrow. Men aren't allowed to drive a car, vote or even go out as unmarried?
20/09/2020, 2:28 pm - +91 77385 57601: By running for better college even after getting better marks than my friend who got into IIT because of his certificate
20/09/2020, 2:28 pm - +91 98337 26449: That's real oppression

20/09/2020, 2:31 pm - +91 98337 26449: A little more
20/09/2020, 2:31 pm - +91 98337 26449: Have a little humanity?
20/09/2020, 2:31 pm - +91 98337 47258: And you know why there are less women in technical fields?
Bcs *statistically* women tend to go towards more creative jobs, less technical
Stats
20/09/2020, 2:32 pm - +91 98337 47258: We have humanity
We think about all IRRESPECTIVE of gender

20/09/2020, 2:32 pm - +91 98337 47258: Most of the suicides happening

20/09/2020, 2:33 pm - +91 98337 26449: You know when Amazon trained an ai to select resumes?
20/09/2020, 2:33 pm - +91 98337 47258: They come in but can't cope up
20/09/2020, 2:33 pm - +91 98337 26449: Did you all heard about that
20/09/2020, 2:33 pm - +91 98337 26449: *hear
20/09/2020, 2:33 pm - +91 98337 26449: The ai only selected men
20/09/2020, 2:33 pm - +91 98337 26449: Because it was trained on that
20/09/2020, 2:33 pm - +91 98337 26449: Because
20/09/2020, 2:33 pm - +91 98337 26449: A majority of the men selected before
20/09/2020, 2:33 pm - +91 98337 26449: Were men
20/09/2020, 2:33 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): I think the argument is that if a man *deserves* to rule the world then he should not be denied because he is a man.
20/09/2020, 2:33 pm - +91 96374 40537: Exactly
20/09/2020, 2:34 pm - +91 98337 26449: That's the whole point of underrepresentation
20/09/2020, 2:34 pm - +91 98337 47258: Sir
Look at the above message
Why it's more men in technical fields
20/09/2020, 2:34 pm - +91 98337 47258: Bcs statistically it's men preferring such jobs
20/09/2020, 2:34 pm - +91 98337 26449: Then give her a chance naa that's the point
20/09/2020, 2:34 pm - +91 77385 57601: Agreed.

20/09/2020, 2:35 pm - +91 98337 47258: Trump and Hillary
20/09/2020, 2:35 pm - +91 98337 47258: Both were given equal chances
20/09/2020, 2:35 pm - +91 98337 47258: People opted for Trump
20/09/2020, 2:35 pm - +91 98337 47258: Both suck
20/09/2020, 2:35 pm - +91 98337 47258: I know
20/09/2020, 2:35 pm - +91 98337 47258: But it wasn't the gender
20/09/2020, 2:35 pm - +91 98337 47258: If you look at the events taken place then, it was her careless acts
20/09/2020, 2:36 pm - +91 98337 47258: New Zealand
20/09/2020, 2:36 pm - +91 99203 34360: How many female leaders have there been in history compared to male?
20/09/2020, 2:36 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): But after giving a chance if she is not as good as a man (for whatever reason) then select the man.
20/09/2020, 2:36 pm - +91 98337 47258: Woman leads there
20/09/2020, 2:36 pm - +91 98337 47258: Why
20/09/2020, 2:36 pm - +91 98337 26449: So trump is all good? He's perfect?
20/09/2020, 2:36 pm - +91 98337 47258: Bcs she deserves

20/09/2020, 2:36 pm - +91 98337 26449: And who decided that? A majority of men? Makes sense
20/09/2020, 2:37 pm - +91 77385 57601: How many stood for elections??

20/09/2020, 2:37 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): There was an OBJECTIVE MEASURE.
20/09/2020, 2:37 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Aka test scores.
20/09/2020, 2:37 pm - +91 99203 34360: Because the society that we live in now periodically favours men
20/09/2020, 2:38 pm - +91 99203 34360: And always has
20/09/2020, 2:38 pm - +91 99203 34360: In every way possible

20/09/2020, 2:38 pm - +91 96190 16721: It's not about chances, lets say government gives a woman land to do agriculture still the people will oppress her and tease her for doing that and not looking after the house chores
20/09/2020, 2:38 pm - +91 99203 34360: To uplift women
20/09/2020, 2:38 pm - +91 98337 47258: That's what they have feeded in your minds

20/09/2020, 2:38 pm - +91 99203 34360: So other women can look up to them
20/09/2020, 2:38 pm - +91 98337 47258: Women weren't allowed to vote right?
20/09/2020, 2:38 pm - +91 98337 26449: It's literally that way for women and African Americans. They've been oppressed for so long. That 10 years of Support isn't gonna go shit

20/09/2020, 3:52 pm - Tushar Nankani: When I sent the message in the morning, the group was open for discussions. I wanted to know everyone's  _opinion_. We wanted to know what everyone thinks about it. 

I didn't want the discussions to be directed at one another or this discussion to scale up into a messy debate. I don't know how it got all scaled up üòÇ

Yes, there are a lot of factors overlapping in situations like gender inequality and the caste system. 

We all got to know about everyone's perspective to look at it. It's simply not black and white. I got to know a lot from this discussion.

Google has recently launched a new facilitator program called Google Cloud Crash Course. Google Cloud Crash Course program will provide engineering students an opportunity to kickstart their learning on cloud technology using practice on GCP (Google Cloud Platform) - the tool that powers apps like Google Search, Gmail and YouTube.

Each campus can nominate one person to be a facilitator and lead this initiative in their college. Upon nomination and selection, these facilitators will receive some training on how to lead these sessions and motivate more students to participate.

If anyone here has some familiarity with cloud and is interested to become a facilitator, dm me.

21/09/2020, 11:03 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Google did Paytm dirty
21/09/2020, 11:06 am - +91 82916 21138: What I read online was ki paytym was given 3 notice but did not change , actually paytym got banned due to his betting games which Google strongly condemns
21/09/2020, 11:07 am - +91 82916 21138: Also it was done to show that Google doesn't care if your company is big or small if you break rules it will taken down
21/09/2020, 11:08 am - +91 77385 57601: As this is also written by paytm only....
21/09/2020, 11:09 am - +91 77385 57601: If someone was using Paytm then they can confirm that if you were able to buy scratch cards and stuff or it was only by recharges and payments
21/09/2020, 11:10 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Yeah but it wasn't gambling right?
21/09/2020, 11:15 am - +91 82916 21138: Idk I heard paytym games had some gambling game and paytym had some add or feature to redirect to that game so Google again doesn't allow it .

21/09/2020, 11:44 am - +91 77385 57601: If you can buy scratch cards then it is gambling

21/09/2020, 11:45 am - +91 77385 57601: And tbh this gambling stuff is very complex
21/09/2020, 11:49 am - +91 77385 57601: Many games have treasure boxes which user can buy and this is almost same as gambling but what they say is it is not gambling because you aren't getting back any real world entity just some game propsü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

23/09/2020, 1:49 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): wait
23/09/2020, 1:49 pm - +91 82916 21138: We define super digit of an integer  using the following rules:
	
	


Given an integer, we need to find the super digit of the integer using recursion.


	
If x has only digit, then its super digit is x.
	Otherwise, the super digit of x is equal to the super digit of the sum of the digits of x.


For example, the super digit of 9875 will be calculated as:

            super_digit(9875)        9+8+7+5 = 29 

            super_digit(29)            2 + 9 = 11

            super_digit(11)            1 + 1 = 2

            super_digit(2)              = 2

27/09/2020, 2:35 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Hey there,

The other day I read this story of a fledgling Python coder named Seth on Reddit:

Seth's been learning Python for 5 months, and things have been "hit and miss" for a while now.

A few weeks ago he completed a free coding course. But since then his progress came to a grinding halt.

Seth's doing fine at the small exercises‚Äîwrite a function here, reverse this list there‚Äîbut when it comes to writing more substantial programs on his own, he just can't get them to work.

When Seth embarked on his "coding journey" a fire burned in his belly, but now he doesn't really feel enthusiastic about anything.

It's not like his motivation is dead and gone‚Äî

Every time he looks at the neat stuff he could use his programming skills for, he knows deep down that he WANTS to learn.

But the fire he once felt for Python and coding in general has faded into a dim glow at this point.

Seth started out learning Python with a friend, but his friend surpassed him within three weeks. 

Seth still feels like a "noob," and when his friend texted him a link to one of his little web app side-projects, Seth ignored the message for days.

How come Seth's progress has been sitting at a standstill? How did he end up in this trap, feeling his stomach churn every time he thinks about writing another line of code?

Seth says he simply has no idea *what* to program in order to get better. He has no project, nor an idea he wants to get started with. 

And he doesn't feel comfortable coding the programs he thinks he *should* be able to code by now. There's no going back or going forward.

I call this "Python Paralysis"...

When you're tired of slogging through another coding tutorial, putting in more effort than most people, but STILL not seeing results... you know why most people don't become professional programmers!

The real problem isn't the effort itself, it's all the other stuff that sabotages the effort.

If you're wondering, I speak from experience here.

Seth's story is pretty much exactly how I felt in the beginning of any big challenge I ever tackled in my life, whether that's learning how to program, getting my first coder job, or becoming self-employed and starting a business.

If you're in the same spot right now, here's what you need to realize:

If you get through this and keep pressing forward, you're going to get to a stage that's a whole lot better. Push through this, and your efforts will start paying off and people will start respecting you.

It takes guts and determination to make it past the "paralysis" and confusion. You need to have conviction, and a tolerance for pain. 

Let me ask you this: How do you KNOW you have a dream? Like, REALLY know it?

When it hurts so bad that you can taste it. When you feel your heart lurch in your chest every time you think about the unfulfilled possibilities.

That's when you need to keep pushing forward, that's when you're oh so close to getting your reward, but you don't see it yet.

Don't throw in the towel. Keep pushing forward. 

And take another step towards your goal.

Do watch!!!
01/10/2020, 3:29 pm - Shubham Chettiar (TSEC CS, TE): Those who have received the credits, they can view the program syllabus here-
https://events.withgoogle.com/30daysofgooglecloud/program-syllabus/#content
and start with their labs
Note-You will get the goodies only if you complete the tracks mentioned on the website

If you haven't received the credits, follow the steps in the image sent below
If you don't get the credits even after following those steps, you can use the "Chat" section on qwiklabs and tell them that you've followed the procedure and still didn't receive credits. 
Mostly, they'll solve your problem, else they'll ask you to wait for the mail
As for the mail, I've asked the officials about the delay in receiving mails, they said they are sending out mail in batches, so you should receive yours latest by 2nd Oct night

//program for an armstrong number or not

//first we take input for the number
let number = prompt("enter a positive no");
//then we calculate the no of digits 
let n = number.length
    //we store our number in a temporary variable
let temp = number
    //variable for summing up the digits raised to the total no of digits
let sum = 0


while (temp > 0) {

    //extracting the last digit
    let rem = temp % 10;

    //summation
    sum += parseInt(rem ** n);

    // removing last digit from the number
    // convert float into integer
    temp = parseInt(temp / 10);
}
console.log(sum)
    //checking for armstrong no.
if (sum == number) {
    console.log(`${number} is an Armstrong number`);
} else {
    console.log(`${number} is not an Armstrong number.`);

I present to you my first real time Data Analysis project - *A Comprehensive WhatsApp Chat Data Analysis!*

I have analyzed this group - *TSEC Coders*, since it is the most active college group! 

Trends that were visualized during the _Exploratory Data Analysis_ were very interesting! 

I have written a detailed _reader friendly Medium Article_ to *showcase this project*.
I hope you all enjoy it!

05/10/2020, 7:13 pm - Vivek (TSEC, CS): Means how to decide which course or quest should we pick next?
05/10/2020, 7:14 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): This is the order imo:

05/10/2020, 7:23 pm - Vivek (TSEC, CS): Ok
05/10/2020, 7:26 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): I don't think so.

05/10/2020, 11:34 pm - +91 77385 57601: @918080142783 what do Class.forName does??
05/10/2020, 11:41 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): That is a part of the reflection API.
05/10/2020, 11:41 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): The reflection API allows you to work with classes during run time.
05/10/2020, 11:41 pm - +91 77385 57601: Abhi vohi dekh raha thaüòÖüòÖ
05/10/2020, 11:41 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Like dynamically loading extensions.
05/10/2020, 11:42 pm - +91 77385 57601: make changes to the class??
05/10/2020, 11:42 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): No, only instantiate and query.
05/10/2020, 11:42 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Meaning you can get a list of all the variables in an object.
05/10/2020, 11:42 pm - +91 77385 57601: Okk
05/10/2020, 11:43 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Wait, I will send an example.

05/10/2020, 11:43 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Ive not used it tho
05/10/2020, 11:43 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): ```void debugPrint(Object o){
	System.out.println(o.getClass().getName() + "{");
	
	for(Field f:o.getClass().getDeclaredFields())

05/10/2020, 11:44 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Don't forget to do ```import java.lang.reflect.*```

05/10/2020, 11:45 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Mini Project?
05/10/2020, 11:45 pm - +91 77385 57601: This will print the whole class againüòÇüòÇ
05/10/2020, 11:45 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): They have to make something in Java
05/10/2020, 11:45 pm - +91 77385 57601: Yesüò¢üò¢
05/10/2020, 11:45 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Yes, very useful for debugging.
05/10/2020, 11:45 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Kya hai?
05/10/2020, 11:45 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Why not use debugger
05/10/2020, 11:46 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è then you have to step through the entire program.
05/10/2020, 11:46 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Yes lol

05/10/2020, 11:48 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): File handling use karna hoga fir
05/10/2020, 11:48 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): We (I and @917506412914 ) were thinking of writing a Teams extension to directly do this.
05/10/2020, 11:48 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): And regex too
05/10/2020, 11:48 pm - +91 77385 57601: Thanks bhai
05/10/2020, 11:48 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Please no.
05/10/2020, 11:48 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Don't use a database.
05/10/2020, 11:48 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Using Teams API?
05/10/2020, 11:49 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Yes.
05/10/2020, 11:49 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Yeah
05/10/2020, 11:49 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Cool
05/10/2020, 11:49 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): There is absolutely no need.
05/10/2020, 11:49 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): In? Python?
05/10/2020, 11:49 pm - +91 77385 57601: Ohkk
05/10/2020, 11:49 pm - +91 77385 57601: Arre voh inko defaulter list bhi chea

05/10/2020, 11:50 pm - +91 77385 57601: jiska attendance 75 se kum hai uska direct list banao
05/10/2020, 11:50 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Pain
05/10/2020, 11:50 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): @917506412914 I think we should do this.
05/10/2020, 11:50 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Java mai hi karna hai yeh sab?
05/10/2020, 11:50 pm - +91 77385 57601: haa sir
05/10/2020, 11:50 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Fü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
05/10/2020, 11:51 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Jabh tak ghante me 10 baar se zyada list nahi bana tabh tak database ki zarurat nahi hai.
05/10/2020, 11:52 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Hafte ya mahene me ek baar hoga na, toh mai bol raha hu, database bahut zyada ho jayega.
05/10/2020, 11:52 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Instead mail the result to them maybe?
05/10/2020, 11:52 pm - +91 77385 57601: Bhai zarurat hume bhi nhi hai iss project ki buss kuch requirements hai jo fulfil karni hai.
05/10/2020, 11:52 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): I mean through script
05/10/2020, 11:53 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): JDBC hai iske,toh aise sikha rhe haiüòÇ

05/10/2020, 11:55 pm - +91 77385 57601: Ye sab IT mein bola jata hai
05/10/2020, 11:55 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Accha
05/10/2020, 11:55 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Toh SQLite use karo.
05/10/2020, 11:55 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Ya FileDB.
05/10/2020, 11:56 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Nahi toh ek csv file bana kar "database" ka naam de de.
05/10/2020, 11:56 pm - +91 77385 57601: Nice ideaüòÇüòÇ
05/10/2020, 11:56 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Lol
05/10/2020, 11:57 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): That is what SQLite does.
05/10/2020, 11:57 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): But in binary format.
05/10/2020, 11:58 pm - +91 77385 57601: Ohh
05/10/2020, 11:58 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): MySQL/JDBC ke chakkar me mat pad.
05/10/2020, 11:59 pm - +91 77385 57601: SQLite ka dekhta hu bhai
05/10/2020, 11:59 pm - +91 77385 57601: @917506412914 baadme kidher hai kya JDBC??
06/10/2020, 12:00 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Why not? good opportunity to learn and implement it
06/10/2020, 12:01 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Yes, but you are missing the point.
06/10/2020, 12:01 am - +91 77385 57601: Bhai 1 time use ka matlab nhi lagta hai
06/10/2020, 12:01 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): If you want to learn JDBC, then yes, go ahead.
06/10/2020, 12:02 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): But the best option for the project is to not use it.
06/10/2020, 12:03 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Mostly because it will complicate things 10x.
06/10/2020, 12:03 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Ok cool
06/10/2020, 12:05 am - Tushar Nankani: www.teamsattendance.com

This is a project by @919930221772
06/10/2020, 12:05 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): üíØüî•
06/10/2020, 12:06 am - +91 77385 57601: Haa bhai dekha ye...
06/10/2020, 12:06 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): I did look at this.
06/10/2020, 12:06 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): But it is not too helpful.
06/10/2020, 12:06 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): The teacher still has to download, upload and mark attendance herself.
06/10/2020, 12:06 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Which is what they are doing now as well.
06/10/2020, 12:07 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): But I am definitely stealing the parsing logic üòÇ
06/10/2020, 12:07 am - Tushar Nankani: It still reduces the work.
06/10/2020, 12:07 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): No, it increases it.
06/10/2020, 12:08 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Now, teachers simply download the csv.
06/10/2020, 12:08 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): If they use the app, they have to upload it as well.
06/10/2020, 12:08 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Granted, most teachers are not bothered about the time spent in class.
06/10/2020, 12:09 am - +91 77385 57601: IT mein nhi
06/10/2020, 12:09 am - Tushar Nankani: Not in our class, Tasneem ma'am checks who sat for the meeting for how much time. Who left early and who joined late.
06/10/2020, 12:10 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): *most*
06/10/2020, 12:10 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Does she use it?
06/10/2020, 12:10 am - Tushar Nankani: I don't know.
06/10/2020, 12:11 am - Tushar Nankani: Then, what will this precisely do?
06/10/2020, 12:12 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): 1. The teacher starts the meeting
2. The teacher (maybe) teaches something
3. The teacher ends the meeting.
06/10/2020, 12:13 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Attendance for each student is automatically captured and displayed in a separate dashboard.
06/10/2020, 12:16 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Fully automated
06/10/2020, 12:16 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Yes.
06/10/2020, 12:17 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): @919930221772‚Äã GitHub kaha hai?
06/10/2020, 12:22 am - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Yes
06/10/2020, 12:23 am - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): What?
06/10/2020, 12:23 am - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): He hasn't made it public...
06/10/2020, 12:24 am - +91 77385 57601: Arre koi or subject mein JDBC hai??

06/10/2020, 12:43 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Then C HAS to come first.
06/10/2020, 12:43 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): ?
06/10/2020, 12:43 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Do you know the kind of obscure errors you encounter in C?

06/10/2020, 1:53 am - +91 73032 50500: That's how the stuff works aaj kal to be honest
06/10/2020, 1:53 am - +91 73032 50500: Abhi somewhere down the line we are also using those crack software/ windows and availing full versions
06/10/2020, 1:53 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): I mean Code with Harry is an excellent you tuber didn't expect him to do it
06/10/2020, 1:54 am - +91 73032 50500: It's that this all sounds horrible because we are in the process of making genuine PR's.

06/10/2020, 4:45 am - +91 99302 21772: Before I built the web app, I spoke to teachers from our college and cold called teachers from other colleges, to make sure this solves a problem. They do care about time attended, especially where attendance is strictly.
06/10/2020, 4:45 am - +91 99302 21772: Strict*

If your child is 6 and is not out there playing Lukka chuppi with Chutki & instead sitting in front of a computer doing _*"Coding"*_ , I am sorry to say but your child is missing out on good parenting & his childhood.

I had a few points to add

What can be a better way to inculcate coding:

1) You introduce a bit of logical + fun puzzles! from around 6-7th class

2) In the schooling years, build their aptitude acche se!

3) And then, introduce to coding!

06/10/2020, 10:34 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): And the inclusion of non conventional subjects as @919987663816 suggested!

Music hua Dance hua

And instead of making them subjects where you have exams
Make em activity based. 
I remember, I had a drawing exam, jisme written theory paper tha!
And it was about Taj mahal and mumtaz and shit man!
And history of art.

I mean usko bhi bekar kar diya in logo ne! Vohi rattophy, and vomit.

07/10/2020, 10:38 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Again, Docker can run any Linux program, including a GUI.
07/10/2020, 10:39 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Then you can connect to it using VNC.
07/10/2020, 10:39 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): So yes.

I mean why would someone want to explicitly define a variable as a *_null_* value

And also, a scenario where *_null_* Gets auto assigned and we get a *_NullPointerException_* Value?
09/10/2020, 9:28 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Talking about Java here
09/10/2020, 9:28 pm - +91 77385 57601: null. Is very useful.
09/10/2020, 9:29 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): ~Value~

09/10/2020, 9:29 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Initialise any object to null
09/10/2020, 9:30 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): And try to access a method from it
09/10/2020, 9:31 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Why would you do that?

09/10/2020, 9:32 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Null is a VERY useful concept in computer science.
09/10/2020, 9:33 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Try telling that to android devs using Java üòÇ

09/10/2020, 9:34 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): It signifies an uninitialised variable and can represent an invalid state.

09/10/2020, 9:34 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): If you can explain like how and an example
09/10/2020, 9:34 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): And in C it causes segmentation fault

or an expected value?
09/10/2020, 9:34 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Hehe
09/10/2020, 9:35 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Invalid*
09/10/2020, 9:35 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Both.
09/10/2020, 9:35 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): For example.
09/10/2020, 9:35 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Say you forgot to instantiate a global variable
09/10/2020, 9:35 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Npe aata hai
09/10/2020, 9:36 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): You have a HashMap.
09/10/2020, 9:36 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): On trying to use the object
09/10/2020, 9:36 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): You try to get a key that is not in the HashMap.
09/10/2020, 9:36 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): What are you supposed to do?
09/10/2020, 9:38 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): You can throw an exception, but exception handling is much more difficult and more error-prone.
09/10/2020, 9:38 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): So you can simply return null
09/10/2020, 9:38 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): okay
09/10/2020, 9:39 pm - +91 77385 57601: Fir null ko handle karo...
09/10/2020, 9:39 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): but then we can not call any methods that we could have called on an object if it wasn't a null valueright?
and thats thy we get a npe
09/10/2020, 9:39 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): ??
09/10/2020, 9:39 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Yes, that is the point.
09/10/2020, 9:40 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): For example:
09/10/2020, 9:40 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): ```Student s = hashmap.get("Abc");
System.out.println(s.rollNumber);```
09/10/2020, 9:41 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): What should the program print if student Abc is not preset?
09/10/2020, 9:41 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): *present
09/10/2020, 9:41 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): it returns a null value?
09/10/2020, 9:42 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): No, it will throw a NullPointerException, which is the right thing to do
09/10/2020, 9:42 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): okay
09/10/2020, 9:42 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): It forces you, as the programmer, to think about the other cases.
09/10/2020, 9:43 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): So, to prevent this
we use try - catch?
09/10/2020, 9:43 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): okay
09/10/2020, 9:43 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): ```Student s = hashmap.get("Abc");

if(s != null)
    System.out.println(s.rollNumber);
else
    System.out.println("Student Abc not found.");```
09/10/2020, 9:43 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): NO.
09/10/2020, 9:44 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): ok we can use if - else
09/10/2020, 9:45 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Let me read more about Exception handling & null values and NullPoninterException
09/10/2020, 9:47 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): also, an empty string is null?

say 
String str = "";
So does str contain null?
09/10/2020, 9:51 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4802015/difference-between-null-and-empty-java-string#:~:text=In%20Java%20a%20reference%20type,any%20kind%2C%20string%20or%20otherwise.&text=%22%22%20and%20null%20both%20are%20different%20.

1) We never really explicitly declare a variable as null
2) As soon as something get returned as null, 
the the program thows npe

You are scaring me now.
09/10/2020, 10:04 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Most definitely not.
09/10/2020, 10:04 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): See the null thing is a huge headache If you do any dev with Java it causes your application to crash

09/10/2020, 10:07 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): And taken into account for garbage collection
09/10/2020, 10:07 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): See the stack memory holds a reference to the Object ,and that reference points to the actual value the object holds in the heap memory

09/10/2020, 10:08 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): !?
09/10/2020, 10:08 pm - +91 97027 35002: ..
09/10/2020, 10:08 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Please, please read up on how the Garbage Collector actually works.
09/10/2020, 10:08 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): So when you specify it as null,the reference is lost
09/10/2020, 10:08 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): If Im am not wrong
09/10/2020, 10:08 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): This part is correct.
09/10/2020, 10:08 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): But the rest is not.
09/10/2020, 10:08 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): And when it isn't associated with any reference
09/10/2020, 10:09 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): The object is taken for garbage collection
09/10/2020, 10:09 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): See, when you create an object, the JVM has adds an internal counter to it..
09/10/2020, 10:09 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): *Deep shit about to follow. üòÖ*
09/10/2020, 10:09 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): When ever you assign that object to a variable, that counter increments by 1.
09/10/2020, 10:10 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Oh
09/10/2020, 10:10 pm - +91 97027 35002: Ohh
09/10/2020, 10:11 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): When a variable goes out of scope, is reassigned or is assigned to null then the counter of the *old object* is decremented by 1.
09/10/2020, 10:11 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Ooh
09/10/2020, 10:11 pm - +91 97027 35002: Oo
09/10/2020, 10:12 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Damn I need to learn the working of JVM,its damn sophisticated
09/10/2020, 10:12 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): The JVM Garbage Collector periodically checks all objects, and if their reference count is ever 0, then that memory is freed.
09/10/2020, 10:12 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Cool
09/10/2020, 10:13 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): say I had an object, with 2 attributes, and I assigned only 1 of them with a value
and i try to access the 2nd one,

will I get an npe?
09/10/2020, 10:13 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Yes.
09/10/2020, 10:13 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Ok thanks
I think I am getting it.
09/10/2020, 10:13 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): üëç

09/10/2020, 10:14 pm - +91 97027 35002: Wait so i cant just free any one object at a time
09/10/2020, 10:14 pm - +91 97027 35002: ?*
09/10/2020, 10:14 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Also, if the reference count drops to 0 during this then the object is freed as well.
09/10/2020, 10:14 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): <Media omitted>
09/10/2020, 10:15 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): NPE in action @918451904417
09/10/2020, 10:15 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): In Java, YOU cannot control when the object is freed.
09/10/2020, 10:15 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Coming back to null.
09/10/2020, 10:15 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Yeah
09/10/2020, 10:15 pm - +91 97027 35002: Ohhh
09/10/2020, 10:15 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): I'm am about to ask something stupid. Pleas just help me out here
09/10/2020, 10:16 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Its good we are learning something new too
09/10/2020, 10:17 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): values may be assigned a null value
but if we access it, it throws an npe.

And if we want out program to not to throw an npe, we use null checks (if - else)

and still if there might be a case where the program throws an npe. we use try - catch to avoid our program from crashing.

Am I correct till now?
09/10/2020, 10:18 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Yes
09/10/2020, 10:18 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): VERY rarely, in multithreaded applications, the JVM is unable to keep track of the references across threads, so explicitly setting the variable to null might help in garbage collection.
09/10/2020, 10:18 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Yes.
09/10/2020, 10:18 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): You can use inbuilt annotations for null checks ,buts that gets kinda complexüòÖ
09/10/2020, 10:19 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Shit.
09/10/2020, 10:19 pm - +91 97027 35002: Ohh wow

If someone wants the video presentation.
09/10/2020, 10:22 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Lower-level languages need a null-like value.
09/10/2020, 10:22 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): But some higher-level languages like Rust and Go replace it with coercion.
09/10/2020, 10:23 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): There are pros and cons of both.
09/10/2020, 10:23 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Hm...

coercion?
Is it a spelling error? 
Or something special?
09/10/2020, 10:23 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): I don't think so.
09/10/2020, 10:24 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): No, the spelling is correct.
09/10/2020, 10:24 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Ok thanks
09/10/2020, 10:24 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Having null means your programs fail if not written correctly.
09/10/2020, 10:25 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Makes sense. Complete sense.
It will make us think, about all edge cases right?
09/10/2020, 10:25 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): üëå
09/10/2020, 10:26 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Not having null means your programs don't crash as often, but it might lead to horrible unintended consequences if you forget to do a null check.
09/10/2020, 10:27 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): ?
09/10/2020, 10:27 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Got it...
09/10/2020, 10:27 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): So like most things in computer science, this is a tradeoff between ease of use and preventing unexpected behavior.

09/10/2020, 10:43 pm - +91 77385 57601: To sum up null is not bad. But handling them is important. 

Now what null-safe languages do is they ask devs to give a value at the time of assignment so the variable is never null.

1 good thing which it does it... compiler doesn't need to check for nulls and process can be run faster.

There are few cases were devs can explicitly say that the variable can be null so compiler takes care of it. 

And null-safe languages promote dev to do null checks for these nullable variables.

09/10/2020, 10:48 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Something I want to explain is the concept of coercion.
09/10/2020, 10:49 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Coercion is used in non-nullable programming languages to ensure a variable is not null.
09/10/2020, 10:50 pm - +91 77385 57601: Yup
09/10/2020, 10:52 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): The downside (or upside, as some people look at it) of non-nullable programming languages is that if a variable is null, then any and all operations performed on it *are skipped*.

09/10/2020, 11:23 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Most non-nullable languages I have seen (like Rust) skip over operations on null values.
09/10/2020, 11:24 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): For example, in Rust ```object.method()``` will call the method if object is null (obviously), but not do anything if object is not null.
09/10/2020, 11:25 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): The rational being that this is such a common pattern that you shouldn't need extra codee.
09/10/2020, 11:25 pm - +91 77385 57601: you can call with object?.method();
09/10/2020, 11:25 pm - +91 77385 57601: but it is like if it is null then its your problem
09/10/2020, 11:26 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Dart seems to take Java's approach of throwing exceptions, but verifying it to the extreme.
09/10/2020, 11:26 pm - +91 77385 57601: Dart follows sound null-safety

10/10/2020, 8:05 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): I had a doubt in Python:
does the print() method convert values to string before printing?

10/10/2020, 8:10 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): If you define an __str__ method on the object then it will be called while printing.
10/10/2020, 8:10 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): It is like Java's toString method.

12/10/2020, 3:03 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): It should auto-complete to PHP7
12/10/2020, 3:04 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Then type in PHP7
12/10/2020, 3:04 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): So the full command will be


```ren C:\PHP7 PHP7```
12/10/2020, 3:04 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): But don't type the first PHP7 yourself.
12/10/2020, 3:04 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): yeah rename

12/10/2020, 7:59 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): I think Apache is the standard.
I think any server would be fine though.
@918080142783 would be the best person to answer this imo.

XAMPP or WAMP is the most commonly used combined dev environments used.
If you have a Linux machine, the LMAP stack is the most famous stack used for PHP.
12/10/2020, 7:59 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Apache httpd is the name, I guess.
12/10/2020, 8:06 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): What you need to understand is there are several different parts:
Apache httpd is one of the original HTTP servers.
MySQL/MariaDB is a database.
PHP is a server side templating (or programming) language.
12/10/2020, 8:11 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): The first protocol was http (hyper text transfer protocol), so the server was called http.
The "d" stands for daemon.
12/10/2020, 8:13 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): A daemon is like a process that runs in the background.
12/10/2020, 8:16 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Ohh
12/10/2020, 8:16 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Thank you I didn't know this.

14/10/2020, 8:16 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Literally aandar ka bahar aa raha hai
14/10/2020, 8:17 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Search button
Aisa kyu?
14/10/2020, 8:17 pm - +91 77385 57601: It is a feature of your website.
14/10/2020, 8:17 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Yes, will provide search feat
14/10/2020, 8:18 pm - +91 77385 57601: Arre chhod nhi samjha tuüòÇ
14/10/2020, 8:18 pm - +91 77385 57601: "Bugs are undocumented features"üòÇüòÇ
14/10/2020, 8:18 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Accha samja
14/10/2020, 8:19 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): But isn't this a serious bug?
Like I want the button placed inside rather than outside
So How can it change the Position?
14/10/2020, 8:30 pm - +91 88284 70904: That might be related to the position of ur search button in ur main container
14/10/2020, 8:30 pm - +91 88284 70904: Check it
14/10/2020, 8:30 pm - +91 88284 70904: I thought u were talking about apps
14/10/2020, 8:30 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): @918329266084  can you check?
14/10/2020, 8:32 pm - +91 77385 57601: Android apps*
14/10/2020, 8:33 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): We'ev used Tailwind CSS
14/10/2020, 8:35 pm - +91 83292 66084: Yup
14/10/2020, 8:48 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): NO!!!
14/10/2020, 8:49 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Use grid.
14/10/2020, 8:49 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Please.
14/10/2020, 8:49 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): It was meant to solve the inconsistencies of Flexbox.
14/10/2020, 8:50 pm - +91 88284 70904: Inline grid?
14/10/2020, 8:51 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): @919867044401
read is to get the next string token (till the next *delimiter*).
readLine is to get all characters till the next *newline*.
14/10/2020, 8:52 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): So if the input is:
```Hello, World!```

```read() -> "Hello"
readLine() -> "Hello, World!"```
14/10/2020, 8:52 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Normal grid will also do.
14/10/2020, 9:10 pm - +91 98670 44401: Got it thx
14/10/2020, 9:10 pm - +91 98670 44401: Thx
14/10/2020, 9:17 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): oops,sorry
This is the code to read a character,using BufferedReader,
char c = (char)br.read();
14/10/2020, 9:23 pm - +91 98670 44401: And what's the reason we can't use readLine() to read a character
14/10/2020, 9:23 pm - +91 98670 44401: Is it because of this token system
14/10/2020, 9:24 pm - +91 98670 44401: Since it's a new token the index position is a string itself and not a character?
14/10/2020, 9:33 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Again, NO!!!
14/10/2020, 9:34 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): ??
14/10/2020, 9:34 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): char c = br.read().charAt(0);
14/10/2020, 9:34 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): it works I tried on shell
14/10/2020, 9:35 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): but the internal working is a bit complex
14/10/2020, 9:37 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Accha BufferedReader.
14/10/2020, 9:37 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Then you don't even need the typecast.
14/10/2020, 9:38 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): char c = br.read();
14/10/2020, 9:40 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): I think its needed
14/10/2020, 9:47 pm - +91 98670 44401: @918080142783 ?
14/10/2020, 9:52 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): You can.
14/10/2020, 9:53 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): char c = sc.readLine().charAt(0);
14/10/2020, 9:53 pm - +91 98670 44401: Kk
14/10/2020, 9:54 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Depends on the readers.
14/10/2020, 9:54 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): BufferedReader returns an int, so it is needed.
14/10/2020, 9:55 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Since Java doesn't allow int -> char conversion directly.
14/10/2020, 10:00 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): ohk
15/10/2020, 5:46 pm - Pratik K (TSEC CS, SE): https://www.interviewbit.com/contest/publicis-sapient-jumpstart-2020?rcy=1&rce=815b77d48e02

15/10/2020, 8:52 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): The navigation drawer UI is dying out :(
15/10/2020, 8:54 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): To be fair, apps were dumping everything in there.
15/10/2020, 8:55 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Have a look at the new one,its terrible looking
15/10/2020, 8:55 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): And bottom tabs are easier to navigate, especially on larger screens.
15/10/2020, 8:55 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Yes this is the reason
15/10/2020, 8:55 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): One thing I feel should be standard is being able to swipe between tabs.
15/10/2020, 8:55 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Nav drawers are difficult to access when using with a single hand
15/10/2020, 10:11 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Yesss
15/10/2020, 10:11 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Yess
15/10/2020, 10:11 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): See google go browser
15/10/2020, 10:11 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): It's really cool
16/10/2020, 12:35 am - +91 77385 57601: + with now swipe to go back
16/10/2020, 1:13 am - +91 77385 57601: @918080142783 can you suggest me an easy way to add validation in JavaFX?
16/10/2020, 1:14 am - +91 77385 57601: ~Easy~ way
16/10/2020, 1:15 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): What kind of validation?
16/10/2020, 1:15 am - +91 77385 57601: Text validation
16/10/2020, 1:16 am - +91 77385 57601: Textfields*
16/10/2020, 1:16 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): For example?
16/10/2020, 1:16 am - +91 77385 57601: I just need to check if the there is something in the fields or not
16/10/2020, 1:16 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): !textbox.getText().isEmpty() ?
16/10/2020, 1:17 am - +91 77385 57601: Haa bhai but error kese dikhau?
16/10/2020, 1:19 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): You will need a separate Label or something for that.
16/10/2020, 1:19 am - +91 77385 57601: Okk matlab extra mehnat...
16/10/2020, 1:19 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): If you will need to do this often, then you can write a custom component.
16/10/2020, 1:20 am - +91 77385 57601: üëçüëç
16/10/2020, 1:21 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Or use a library...
16/10/2020, 1:21 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): JavaFX has some nice matrial design ones.
16/10/2020, 1:21 am - +91 77385 57601: I tried controlsfx n jfeohix
16/10/2020, 1:22 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): And?
16/10/2020, 1:22 am - +91 77385 57601: Controlsfx gave me an error... I can't validate 2 fields at a time....2nd wale ka I'm figuring out
16/10/2020, 1:22 am - +91 77385 57601: Buss
16/10/2020, 1:22 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): If you are using a library then I strongly recommend you also use a dependency manager like maven or ant
16/10/2020, 1:23 am - +91 77385 57601: Okküëçüëç
16/10/2020, 1:23 am - +91 77385 57601: Ab sab kl karunga... Dimag band hogaya hai abhiü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüòÖ

16/10/2020, 1:24 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Mostly geared towards android.
16/10/2020, 1:24 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Oh
16/10/2020, 1:24 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): maven/ant is more general purpose.
16/10/2020, 1:24 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Thats why I use themüòÖ, aadat hai
16/10/2020, 1:25 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Maven I've seen being used
16/10/2020, 1:25 am - +91 77385 57601: I'm thinking to disable the button until user adds something to the field üòÇ
16/10/2020, 1:26 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): I think changing the border of invalid fields to red is also good.

18/10/2020, 12:04 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Guys, need help.
What does one look for while buying a laptop?

Any suggestions for a laptop, to be used for college/coding/projects purposes?
18/10/2020, 12:06 pm - Pranav Dani: Number of cores on your processor, Ram , graphics card (if you know you know), screen if creative work and overall package
18/10/2020, 12:06 pm - Saket (TSEC, CS): Yt has tons of videos!
18/10/2020, 12:07 pm - Pranav Dani: Go for any amd ryzen 4000 series laptop 
Dont look at intel atleast rn
18/10/2020, 12:07 pm - Pranav Dani: Intel is not bad but amd is providing more than intel for less
18/10/2020, 12:08 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): If you can, get a desktop.
18/10/2020, 12:09 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Much better performance than a similarly priced laptop.
18/10/2020, 12:09 pm - Pranav Dani: Yeah but if you know you are not travelling with it
18/10/2020, 12:10 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Actually it is for a friend
Ill share with yall what he was asking
Accordoing to mee its over kill
But you guys say
18/10/2020, 12:10 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): https://dl.flipkart.com/dl/hp-pavilion-gaming-core-i5-9th-gen-8-gb-1-tb-hdd-256-gb-ssd-windows-10-home-4-graphics-nvidia-geforce-gtx-1650-15-dk0272tx-laptop/p/itm58e923572f6a0?pid=COMFU2RFF4TQX2AA&cmpid=product.share.pp
18/10/2020, 12:10 pm - Pranav Dani: Nope
18/10/2020, 12:10 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): this is what he is thinking about
18/10/2020, 12:10 pm - Pranav Dani: Bad choice
18/10/2020, 12:11 pm - Pranav Dani: last year ka hai
18/10/2020, 12:13 pm - Pranav Dani: 4 core 8 threads
18/10/2020, 12:13 pm - Pranav Dani: 10th gen also sucks
18/10/2020, 12:13 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): As I said, if you can.
18/10/2020, 12:14 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Try asking him about the desktop.
18/10/2020, 12:14 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): cool
18/10/2020, 12:53 pm - +91 97027 35002: Please dont go for amd in a laptop
18/10/2020, 12:54 pm - Pranav Dani: Why
18/10/2020, 12:54 pm - +91 97027 35002: Requires more power ergo less battery life
18/10/2020, 12:54 pm - Pranav Dani: Wth
18/10/2020, 12:54 pm - Pranav Dani: Kuch bhi
18/10/2020, 12:54 pm - +91 97027 35002: Amd is better for a pc
18/10/2020, 12:55 pm - Pranav Dani: Nope it has one of the best efficiencies in a processor
18/10/2020, 12:57 pm - +91 97027 35002: Bhai amd processors bohot heat hote hai agar wo extensive use karega he'll damage his system
18/10/2020, 1:00 pm - Pranav Dani: This message was deleted
18/10/2020, 1:01 pm - Pranav Dani: Nope
18/10/2020, 1:01 pm - Pranav Dani: Data never lies
18/10/2020, 1:01 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Maybe that was an issue with the laptop model you were using?
18/10/2020, 1:01 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Have you tried to clean the fan ports?
18/10/2020, 1:02 pm - Pranav Dani: I am talking about 4000 series specifically not older ones
18/10/2020, 1:02 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Sometimes they get so clogged with dust that airflow is severely restricted.
18/10/2020, 1:03 pm - Pranav Dani: And you need to change the thermal paste after two years
18/10/2020, 1:03 pm - Pranav Dani: In laptop also
18/10/2020, 1:03 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): That not cause such an issue.
18/10/2020, 1:03 pm - Pranav Dani: But this statement is not correct
18/10/2020, 1:03 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Hardly a 1-2¬∞ change.
18/10/2020, 1:04 pm - Pranav Dani: Yeah but something is better than nothing
18/10/2020, 1:04 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): You recently bought an AMD laptop na?
18/10/2020, 1:04 pm - Pranav Dani: Yes
18/10/2020, 1:04 pm - +91 97027 35002: Yes happened with one of my friend he used to game extensively 5 months me problems chalu
18/10/2020, 1:04 pm - Pranav Dani: Which laptop
18/10/2020, 1:05 pm - +91 97027 35002: Wait
18/10/2020, 1:05 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Ask him to clean the fan ports.
18/10/2020, 1:05 pm - Pranav Dani: Amd ryzen 3550h is not that good though
18/10/2020, 1:05 pm - Pranav Dani: .
18/10/2020, 1:05 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Preferably after opening the laptop.
18/10/2020, 1:05 pm - +91 97027 35002: <Media omitted>
18/10/2020, 1:05 pm - Pranav Dani: Bruh
18/10/2020, 1:05 pm - Pranav Dani: 3550h is not good
18/10/2020, 1:06 pm - Pranav Dani: .
18/10/2020, 1:06 pm - +91 97027 35002: 4800 ka price dekha hai?üòÇ
18/10/2020, 1:06 pm - Pranav Dani: 4600h ka dekha??
18/10/2020, 1:06 pm - Pranav Dani: 4800 kyu lena hai?
18/10/2020, 1:07 pm - Pranav Dani: Are you like a video creator wo bhi ekdum high level wala ya fir kya use kya hai usla
18/10/2020, 1:07 pm - +91 97027 35002: Pc hi leno naüòÖ
18/10/2020, 1:07 pm - Pranav Dani: What will you do with 8 cores and 16 threads?
18/10/2020, 1:08 pm - Pranav Dani: This thing is comparable to a core i9 10th gen
18/10/2020, 1:08 pm - Pranav Dani: This is better than core i7 10650h
18/10/2020, 1:08 pm - +91 97027 35002: Isnt that what he wants?
18/10/2020, 1:08 pm - Pranav Dani: What?
18/10/2020, 1:08 pm - +91 97027 35002: 9th sorry mu bad
18/10/2020, 1:09 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Oooh that is great for compiling large programs.
18/10/2020, 1:09 pm - +91 91677 97590: Do not go for any of the tuf series, they all have major heating issues
18/10/2020, 1:09 pm - Pranav Dani: Yeah but this is an overkill
18/10/2020, 1:09 pm - +91 97027 35002: Just this series?
18/10/2020, 1:09 pm - Pranav Dani: Nope
18/10/2020, 1:09 pm - Pranav Dani: It depends
18/10/2020, 1:09 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): If you are working on a large project then not at all.
18/10/2020, 1:09 pm - +91 91677 97590: All the current models of this series at least
18/10/2020, 1:10 pm - Pranav Dani: If you go for more than GTX 1650ti like 1660or rtx wagiare then don't go for this
18/10/2020, 1:10 pm - Pranav Dani: No
18/10/2020, 1:10 pm - Pranav Dani: Data never lies
18/10/2020, 1:12 pm - Pranav Dani: Anyways if you got cash to burn you can always go overkill
18/10/2020, 1:13 pm - +91 91677 97590: <Media omitted>
18/10/2020, 1:13 pm - Pranav Dani: Have you heard about ryzen controller?
18/10/2020, 1:14 pm - +91 91677 97590: Look buddy, this is what I've heard I have no first hand experience, so I'm saying based off this
18/10/2020, 1:14 pm - Pranav Dani: Do you know MacBook Air crosses 90¬∞ during normal tasks
18/10/2020, 1:14 pm - Pranav Dani: And it has a freaking 25w tdp
18/10/2020, 1:15 pm - Pranav Dani: This thing has 45w tdp and 54 at max
18/10/2020, 1:15 pm - Pranav Dani: Use this to limit TDP
18/10/2020, 1:15 pm - Pranav Dani: Or else usme temp based settings bhi hai
18/10/2020, 1:35 pm - Pranav Dani: Yeah I get it
18/10/2020, 1:35 pm - +91 91677 97590: I myself was looking for options so I was researching and I came accross this
18/10/2020, 1:44 pm - Pranav Dani: I waited for more than a year before purchasing a laptop I have my own stats about every laptop
I know asus runs a bit warm
But just look at the sheer value proposition
Then there is hp pavilion series with 4600h even that has a same story
Then there's hp omen which is the only laptop which runs cool currently
Then there's dell G5 se with rx5600m which was a shit show (this laptop could have killed the market but it has significant flaws)


Now people talking about temps are referring to temps during games
Baki other than games it's not at all a thing to consider
During games both GPU cpu are being pushed baki time time heat is non existant (which is like most of the time) and that heart can also be controlled
18/10/2020, 1:51 pm - Shubham Chettiar (TSEC CS, TE): 4600 is better in everything than i7 10th  except for gaming
18/10/2020, 1:51 pm - Shubham Chettiar (TSEC CS, TE): So consider that while buying it
18/10/2020, 1:52 pm - Shubham Chettiar (TSEC CS, TE): Cpu intensive games like csgo and Valorant don't work perfectly on 4600
18/10/2020, 2:04 pm - Pranav Dani: Like ok if you are into that but still the difference is not ground breaking 4-5% at max and cost at which i7 comes is also higher you could run dual channel 16gigs and gain a performance boost like 145 fps to 200 fps for dual channel atleast for valorant if you see stats
18/10/2020, 2:07 pm - Shubham Chettiar (TSEC CS, TE): The difference is quite noticable in my case
I've got a 4600 with 1650 to, in csgo my frames drop to about 120 fps which shouldn't be the case for a game which came out 6-8 years ago
Whereas my friend's got the same specs with an i7, he gets constant frames around 200
18/10/2020, 2:08 pm - Pranav Dani: Get a dual channel ram and check again if it is 8 gigs
18/10/2020, 2:08 pm - Pranav Dani: Like not dual channel ram
18/10/2020, 2:08 pm - Shubham Chettiar (TSEC CS, TE): I'm talking about the same specsüòÇ
18/10/2020, 2:08 pm - Shubham Chettiar (TSEC CS, TE): 8gb single stick
18/10/2020, 2:08 pm - Pranav Dani: Yeah got it
18/10/2020, 2:09 pm - Pranav Dani: Yeah but 8gb cl22 single channel 3200mhz ram should get you a frame gain of 40-50 fps in valrant minimum and you can't see those frames even if produced so idk ig
18/10/2020, 2:10 pm - Pranav Dani: Valorant*

18/10/2020, 9:41 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): @919967558551 
1. Please, please, please format your code properly.
2. Compile with -Wall -pedantic
3. There is an error in your logic:

if(front==NULL){
	front->data=x;
	front->next=NULL;
	rear=front;
}

Here, if front is null, you are dereferencing it without allocating memory.

26/10/2020, 1:40 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Researchers at some university had got a new computer.
They were supposed to schedule time to work on the computer for their respective projects.
But there were a lot of scheduling conflicts, and every week, it took hours to make the schedule.
So some researchers invented Prolog to automatically make the schedule.

26/10/2020, 1:42 pm - +91 77385 57601: Over engineering koi inse sikheüòÇ
26/10/2020, 1:43 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Prolog was designed so that everyone could write the time slots they were free in, and the program would automatically find the optimal schedule.

Eg:
A: 13:00 to 14:00
B: 13:30 to 14:00

Then specify the time:
A: 30 minutes
B: 30 minutes
26/10/2020, 1:43 pm - +91 77385 57601: Don't tell me prolog was the 1st language which could be used to ml ka purpose üòÇ

26/10/2020, 1:43 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): prolog is used for ML right?

28/10/2020, 12:54 pm - Tushar Nankani: So true! 

Everyone's rushing through the syllabus, taking extra classes, giving bunch load of assignments, and mini projects. 

The lectures are exhausting itself. On Wednesdays, we have 8 to 5 straight, and I don't see any point.

Everyone is so exhausted till the end, that there's no energy left to do something else, apart from just doing assignments, which we have to do, because there's a deadline hanging on our head.

28/10/2020, 1:00 pm - Tushar Nankani: And he is right, online methods are not efficient.

Possible solutions could be reducing some percentage of syllabus in the final exams, and if that's not possible, at least MPRs have some meaning, so probably reducing the assignments. Or giving typed assignments.

They both have totally different approaches. 

In kotlin multi-platform you only share the logic and you need to make UI for each platform.

In Flutter you not only logic but UI as well

02/11/2020, 1:31 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): There is a lot of overlap in WSL and Docker.
02/11/2020, 1:31 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): What?
02/11/2020, 1:32 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Again, I would prefer Docker because you can run multiple different containers.
02/11/2020, 2:30 pm - +91 77385 57601: You can share your docker images
02/11/2020, 2:33 pm - +91 77385 57601: Damn you can do this as well but its not simpleüòÖ

02/11/2020, 2:47 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Yes. One of the reasons I prefer Docker.
02/11/2020, 2:47 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Why???
02/11/2020, 2:49 pm - +91 77385 57601: Exactly why would you run different linux environment but you can do that in WSL
02/11/2020, 2:50 pm - +91 77385 57601: and wsl was to build let user run linux along side win not to put your container on cloud
02/11/2020, 2:51 pm - +91 77385 57601: So both are different technologies, don't compare them.
02/11/2020, 2:52 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Because I can:
1. Run different distros
2. Save and restore containers
3. Have multiple isolated containers
4. Not worry about making a mistake and crashing Windows or corroding WSL.
02/11/2020, 2:52 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): I am not saying Docker is better than WSL or even that these things can be compared.
02/11/2020, 2:53 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): But in this use case, I feel Docker containers are better than WSL **to run Linux on Windows**

I have doubt regarding multi-threading,here I see the contents of the ```run()``` executes followed by the for loop in my main function,why isn't multi-threading happening in this case?I expected the main and child thread to execute together!?
03/11/2020, 2:29 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): why does the main thread wait for the child thread to execute?
03/11/2020, 2:36 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Update:I increased the loop to 1000 iterations,now they do appear to be executing parallely,even then the main thread is way too slow as compared to the child,Im not able to get a clear picture of whats happening here

03/11/2020, 4:13 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): 1. VERY easy to make mistakes.
2. Threading bugs are a nightmare.
3. Reduces efficiency.
03/11/2020, 4:13 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Dcoder gave this
03/11/2020, 4:14 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Thead-0 needs some time to start up.

03/11/2020, 4:14 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Yeah
03/11/2020, 4:15 pm - +91 97681 67131: I agree reduced efficiency but in specific cases it‚Äôs the optimal solution
03/11/2020, 4:15 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Mujhe project uske application ka banana thaüôàüò¨
03/11/2020, 4:15 pm - +91 97681 67131: Regaurding mistakes yup they are easy to make but practice reduces them ..
03/11/2020, 4:15 pm - +91 77385 57601: Toh locking ka bana
03/11/2020, 4:16 pm - +91 77385 57601: Voh toh obviously practice sab karta hai
03/11/2020, 4:17 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Yes, but why do you want to take the chance?
03/11/2020, 4:18 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): I am not suggesting you don't use them at all, but try to avoid them.
03/11/2020, 4:18 pm - +91 97681 67131: I agree who said I personally use this. But, since @919820696178 asked this üòÇ
03/11/2020, 4:18 pm - +91 97681 67131: Yup there u go..
03/11/2020, 4:18 pm - +91 77385 57601: Try avoiding multi threading
03/11/2020, 4:18 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): NO.

03/11/2020, 4:19 pm - +91 77385 57601: Arre bhai seriously nhi bola chill maar tu
03/11/2020, 4:19 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Look at CompletableFuture and ForkJoinThreadPool.
03/11/2020, 4:19 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Tera bharosa nahi hai.

03/11/2020, 4:21 pm - +91 77385 57601: Ab threading karna padega toh karna padega no options na
03/11/2020, 4:39 pm - +91 82916 21138: It's called race condition so issliye user cannot find that out context switching happens at any instant thus
03/11/2020, 4:40 pm - +91 82916 21138: Like in race condition both threads try to utilize CPU at same time so it depends on machine to to machine and every time you might get some different output
03/11/2020, 5:09 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Again, NO.
03/11/2020, 5:10 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): This is NOT a race condition.
03/11/2020, 5:10 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): This is called process scheduling.
03/11/2020, 5:13 pm - +91 82916 21138: Yes but they are trying take the same resources at same time üòÖ
03/11/2020, 5:13 pm - +91 82916 21138: Like scheduling is done by itself but both arise at same time
03/11/2020, 5:16 pm - +91 82916 21138: And both threads are trying to change same variable then race condition occurs
03/11/2020, 5:16 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): You have misunderstood the meaning of race condition.
03/11/2020, 5:17 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): This is somewhat correct.
03/11/2020, 5:17 pm - +91 82916 21138: Yeah maybe üòÖ but what I had read it was if two process or resources try to change a shared variable at same time then this occurs become context switching is not assured
03/11/2020, 5:18 pm - +91 82916 21138: Idk I had read this in my os subject üòÖ maybe I am wrong
03/11/2020, 5:18 pm - +91 82916 21138: Process /threads *
03/11/2020, 5:21 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): A race condition is when two (or more) threads perform operations where the order is important.

Eg:

```let a = [];

Thread 1: a.push(1);
Thread 2: a.push(2);```

Now a can be ```[1, 2]``` or ```[2, 1]```
03/11/2020, 5:21 pm - +91 82916 21138: Yes like producer consumer etc
03/11/2020, 5:22 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Yes.
03/11/2020, 5:49 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): we can use ```synchronized``` keyword

04/11/2020, 2:09 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): The ones which are refurbished 
Waha seller ka number and email

Ones which we are selling 
For that you need to add to cart and generate a receipt
04/11/2020, 2:10 pm - +91 77385 57601: Okk...
04/11/2020, 2:10 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): So,

04/11/2020, 2:47 pm - +91 72495 29889: Thank you..
04/11/2020, 2:48 pm - Tushar Nankani: Really good work! The overall color coordination is amazing. Everything looks nice, smooth and professional. 

If you are planning to launch it:
- For the store, will your seller/supplier deliver at homes? Since you're keeping cash on delivery?
- For the enlisting/reburfished items, you can simply let the students decide, they can probably contact each other and decide a meeting point for the transaction. And once the product is sold, there can be a button: ```sold``` or simply delete the item, since right now we can't delete the enlisted items. 


Enhancements:

- The home page is really nice and classy. Maybe the opening page shouldn't be a calculator. It can be merged down with labcoats, books and instruments. The opening page could be the tagline. 

- The buttons on the home page are much larger then the remaining font, so maybe the font can be reduced to make it much more readable. 

- Also, there are 3 kinds of buttons, the one on the home page, the one on the cart and one in refurbished. All are of different kinds, and usually when browsing through a website, like how a font is kept constant, buttons of a similar kind could be kept constant throughout. 

- When we click on `More about product`, under refurbished, the email and contact of seller is not linked yet, though, in `seller details` it is mentioned. 

- All of your social media handles are linked to your website currently.

- Minor checks are yet to be implemented as sirus mentioned, but those happen slowly and will be implemented over time when more users will test your website!

- A minor UI change on the refurbishment cards. (Will send a picture soon.)


Really, really good work! Very neatly done. Kudos to the team! üëèüèªüôåüèª ^_^
04/11/2020, 2:50 pm - +91 72495 29889: Thank you for all the feedback.
Much appreciated and will surely work on this.

04/11/2020, 2:51 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Thank you so much @919987663816 
For that detailed review.
Exactly what I was looking for!
We will try to implement all these changes in v2.0
We did cut some corners because time was limited 
but its gonna upgrade soon
04/11/2020, 2:51 pm - +91 77385 57601: More about product ko you can remove and let user click on it
04/11/2020, 2:51 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Got you.

04/11/2020, 2:55 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): IMO
- Delete button & Validation will be really important for the  MVP
So, will include that before submitting. 
Rest all improvements will try to incorporate when we actually launch it
04/11/2020, 2:55 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Hey don't worry

04/11/2020, 3:25 pm - Ankit (TSEC, CS): you can copy the values and everything but idt you can export it directly
04/11/2020, 3:26 pm - +91 72495 29889: You can't export directly
04/11/2020, 3:26 pm - +91 72495 29889: yes!

04/11/2020, 3:29 pm - +91 99302 21772: Building from scratch isn't the best option

08/11/2020, 7:53 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Purging, as I understood was
Eliminating the unused CSS in production from the whole TailwindCSS library.
So, in its final form in production, you have only the CSS you require and not bloatware.
08/11/2020, 7:54 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Vocal for local

08/11/2020, 7:56 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): He is saying
I purged these files, meaning before building remove unused CSS from these files.
Not sure, I will have to read more about it...
08/11/2020, 7:58 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): This might solve what the issue @918080142783 was saying
Like if I need only a small part of a Library
then why should the whole library load...

08/11/2020, 7:58 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): But if it is unused the browser won't render it right?then how does it slow the site down?
08/11/2020, 7:59 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): https://tailwindcss.com/docs/controlling-file-size

09/11/2020, 6:35 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): for what?
09/11/2020, 6:36 pm - Hardik Raheja (TSEC, CS): I'm doing an online course. I have to include classes included in a jar file in my program to run it
09/11/2020, 6:37 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): What are they?I mean can you exactly tell what are you trying to include?
09/11/2020, 6:37 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): like something in build path?
09/11/2020, 6:37 pm - Hardik Raheja (TSEC, CS): Like we import default libraries it's a command at the beginning to import classes from the file.
09/11/2020, 6:38 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): if you want to use external classes then you can do so using a build tool like maven or gradle
09/11/2020, 6:38 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): like JavaFX?
09/11/2020, 6:38 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): I could perhaps help if you name it

09/11/2020, 6:39 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Consider using an IDE if you are using something which isn't a part of the jdk
09/11/2020, 6:40 pm - Hardik Raheja (TSEC, CS): algs4.jar
09/11/2020, 6:40 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Wait

09/11/2020, 7:53 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): and do it through the command line wala method the other method will pollute the environment variables
09/11/2020, 7:55 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): first check your classpath using:
```echo %CLASSPATH%```
09/11/2020, 7:56 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): if it responds with ```%CLASSPATH%```,then it means it has not been set yet
09/11/2020, 8:12 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): What? No.
09/11/2020, 8:12 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): this is just to check if exists or not
09/11/2020, 8:13 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): this means it has not been defined
09/11/2020, 8:16 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): The correct way to compile a file that uses a library is:

```java -cp algs4.jar Program.java```
09/11/2020, 8:17 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Don't touch class path right now.
09/11/2020, 8:17 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): It can cause weird issues.
09/11/2020, 8:17 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): echo just displays it
09/11/2020, 8:17 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): (system)
09/11/2020, 8:18 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): I know, but still.
09/11/2020, 8:18 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): I tried it
09/11/2020, 8:18 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): mine hasnt been defined yet
09/11/2020, 8:18 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Never underestimate the stupidity of people (no offense intended).
09/11/2020, 8:19 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): I mean messing with env yeah,its dangerous
09/11/2020, 8:19 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Someone will manage to set an invalid classpath, then complain that they are unable to compile Java programs.
09/11/2020, 8:20 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Local env is not too bad, since it is reset when you open a new terminal window.
09/11/2020, 8:20 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): its safe to do so through cmd,since it would apply only to that particular project
09/11/2020, 8:20 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): oh
09/11/2020, 8:20 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): No, local env persists for a terminal session.
09/11/2020, 8:21 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): ok
09/11/2020, 8:21 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): will this persist permanently?
09/11/2020, 8:23 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): What do you mean?
Nothing is going to persist.
09/11/2020, 8:23 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): This is a standalone command.
09/11/2020, 8:23 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): so you will have to use the command again and again on opening a new terminal?
09/11/2020, 8:24 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): the oracle docs recommen set classpath wala command
09/11/2020, 8:25 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/tools/windows/classpath.html
09/11/2020, 8:26 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): No.
09/11/2020, 8:26 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): The preferred way to specify the class path is by using the -cp command line switch. This allows the CLASSPATH to be set individually for each application without affecting other applications. Setting the CLASSPATH can be tricky and should be performed with care.
09/11/2020, 8:26 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/environment/paths.html

09/11/2020, 8:30 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): I would recommend creating a .bat file called ```run``` or something that has the command with the full classpath so that you don't have to type it each time.

Means elements sorted rahenge in ascending order

10/11/2020, 9:40 pm - Tushar Nankani: Enhancements:

- Once pressed on visualize, the remaining buttons can be disabled. Right now, when clicked on shuffle array or Generate Random Array, while the sorting is going on, will shuffle the array and the sorting will start again. 

- A minor check on the maximum size of the array can be implemented. I think after 3000 elements, the size becomes so small, that the sorting isn't visible and the white bars become black. 

Looking forward to more algorithms being visualized and a collaboration with @917208176024! üëèüèªüíØüòÇ

11/11/2020, 12:14 am - +91 77385 57601: Fake feminism bro...jisko zarurat hai usko kuch bhav nhi milta hai jo privileged hai voh fayda lete hai...

No offence but sach hai.
11/11/2020, 12:46 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Can someone explain what is Agile?
I know I can Google it. But I am just too lazy to...
About to drop dead any moment now...
11/11/2020, 12:46 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Then it might be better to go through it in the morning.
11/11/2020, 12:46 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): software dev principle hai ek
11/11/2020, 12:46 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Cool thanks...
11/11/2020, 12:46 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): exactly
11/11/2020, 12:47 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): but DevOps has taken over now
11/11/2020, 12:47 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Agile is a development methodology.
11/11/2020, 12:47 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): WHAT?!?!?
11/11/2020, 12:47 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): NO!
11/11/2020, 12:47 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): GOD
11/11/2020, 12:47 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): HOW?!
11/11/2020, 12:47 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): I saw this in a YT video
11/11/2020, 12:47 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): telusko
11/11/2020, 12:48 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è of course.
11/11/2020, 12:48 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): waterfall model
11/11/2020, 12:48 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): then Agile
11/11/2020, 12:48 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): now DevOps right?
11/11/2020, 12:49 am - +91 77385 57601: Kisliye tha ye?
11/11/2020, 12:50 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): This is correct.
11/11/2020, 12:50 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): So it this.
11/11/2020, 12:50 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): There is also one more something: Kanban
Ill read about in the morning....
11/11/2020, 12:50 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): yes
11/11/2020, 12:50 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): But I don't think you understand DevOps.
11/11/2020, 12:50 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Dev Ops = Development + Operations.
11/11/2020, 12:50 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): then there is scrum which helps you to be agile
11/11/2020, 12:50 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): yes ik
11/11/2020, 12:50 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): So it is a combination of Agile + IT support.
11/11/2020, 12:51 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): ohk
11/11/2020, 12:51 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Meaning the same team that develops the product also provides support, since they know the code the best.
11/11/2020, 12:51 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): I also thought,I will send the YT video
11/11/2020, 12:52 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Technically, not only agile, it can be any software development method.
11/11/2020, 12:53 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): But DevOps is the merging of Coding and Support.
It is like an extension to Agile, but it doesn't replace it.
11/11/2020, 12:54 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): üëç
11/11/2020, 1:09 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Hey guys? Need your favour.. I am Mohit Varma and I write blogs and articles too and I am sure some of you know about it...

LinkedIn, Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, etc...
11/11/2020, 6:12 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): ?
11/11/2020, 7:53 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): And that is why I am not on any of those platforms.

12/11/2020, 12:01 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): To be perfectly honest, it is not a completely stupid idea.
12/11/2020, 12:01 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Look up Nebula.
12/11/2020, 12:02 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): But, 30k me?
12/11/2020, 12:02 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): More than enough for a pilot.
12/11/2020, 12:02 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): But everything depends on the content.
12/11/2020, 12:03 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): YouTube was successful because:
- It was first
- It was free
12/11/2020, 12:03 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): A new platform will not have any of those advantages.
12/11/2020, 12:04 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Nebula is also struggling because it is VERY difficult to make people pay for something they can get for free.
12/11/2020, 12:04 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Thoughtful.
12/11/2020, 12:04 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Yes. Agreed
12/11/2020, 12:05 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): As a side note, this is the backbone of the GPL liscence.

12/11/2020, 9:35 pm - +91 70219 80066: To run java web application is it necessary to use Apache Tomcat server  or I can use normal Apache server?
12/11/2020, 9:49 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Apache Tomcat is a web container for servlets
12/11/2020, 9:50 pm - +91 70219 80066: Okk
12/11/2020, 10:30 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Ive never used servlets but ig you need containers if you are dynamically generating webpages on server side

15/11/2020, 10:10 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): See upstream repo pe some mess had happened,so force push kiya tha
15/11/2020, 10:11 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Fir woh merge nahi ho rhe the so upstream se changes local mai aa gaye
15/11/2020, 10:11 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): But remote nahi ja rhe
15/11/2020, 10:11 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): I think this caused the issue

15/11/2020, 10:45 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): that is the reason I only work with safe sounding commands.
I know I must experiment a bit or learn to use them 

but these are the only commands I use:

git init
git status
git add .
git commit -m "LOL"
git push origin master/main


and me and my parter always only coded together (pair coding)

so we never really came across merge conflicts
whenever my work was done 
I push
he pulls 

when ever his work is done
He pushes 
I pull
15/11/2020, 10:46 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): once or twice I used 
git reset --hard
when I got pissed off with my code
but then
that was that

16/11/2020, 12:28 am - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): The first question was just dumb to ask!
Does Google know that I was sitting next to person XYZ.
Like common.

Next all questions were valid ‚úÖ
and
He had answers to all of them.
You have the choice to turn off ad personalization

So I don't really see a problem with that.
Again with voice data, he said it records only when we say Ok Google
so that is in a way that you are providing consent to record your voice data
they can also use that data to train their models
As you are using their service. So they want to provide the best of service to you!
16/11/2020, 12:29 am - +91 77385 57601: Google is listening to you everytime! Leaks nhi dekhe kya?

Built using React. Even the desktop app is actually Web App. 
Served via Electron

19/11/2020, 1:49 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): I really like BlueJ, and usually prefer it over other IDEs like IntelliJ Idea because it is smaller and faster.

19/11/2020, 1:50 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): BlueJ allows you to understand the program, without all the magic of IntelliJ.
19/11/2020, 1:50 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Most definitely not, it is a very capable IDE for small projects.
19/11/2020, 1:55 pm - +91 77385 57601: Yes!

21/11/2020, 4:10 pm - Saket (TSEC, CS): I liked the project.üíØ

Feature Enhancements :

1. The edge length between current inserted Node and it's parent should be less than that of edge length between any of its ancestors , so it makes eaiser to undertsand about positioning of nodes.

2. Can you make it dynamic ?, like instead of taking input by asking left and right, you take a node and just insert it where it should be placed.
21/11/2020, 4:20 pm - Tushar Nankani: You deleted this message
21/11/2020, 4:23 pm - Tushar Nankani: Glad you liked the project.

We did think of continuing taking inputs, but in Turbo C it can't be dynamic. Once we create a tree, after that, we have to use the functions like ```cleardevice()``` and ```closegraph()``` which leads to clearing the screen and it doesn't print anything else, which leads to closing of the program, eventually. 

That's a major drawback of this method, since this a non-traditional way of making a visualizer, using JavaScript being the traditional approach.
21/11/2020, 4:23 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): > since this a non-traditional way of making a visualizer, using JavaScript being the traditional approach.

No.
21/11/2020, 4:23 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): That is incorrect.
21/11/2020, 4:23 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): The earliest programs (visualizers, image editors, graphic displays) were written in C.
21/11/2020, 4:24 pm - Tushar Nankani: I meant, _usually_ visualizers are made using JavaScript  and deployed.
21/11/2020, 4:25 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): While this might be a limitation of Turbo C, you can do this buy using a standalone version of graphics.h and gcc.
21/11/2020, 4:25 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Again, no.
21/11/2020, 4:26 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): what is that!?
21/11/2020, 4:26 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): What is what?
21/11/2020, 4:36 pm - Saket (TSEC, CS): This message was deleted
21/11/2020, 4:36 pm - Saket (TSEC, CS): Yes even J thought making it dynamic would be a constrain. 

Try implementing point 1 , I can give gist of implementation , like try to store a variable Len(Edge length between currentNode and it's parent) then whenever you insert a child(childNode) to this currentNode use the Len variable of currentNode and do something like this 

```childNode.Len = currentNode.Len/ratio;``` 

I suggest to keep this ratio between 1.5 and 2.
21/11/2020, 4:39 pm - Saket (TSEC, CS): I*
21/11/2020, 4:45 pm - Tushar Nankani: Got it.

24/11/2020, 11:00 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): So they *can* very easily port over to JS/WebAssembly.
24/11/2020, 11:01 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): But PWA's are still new, and this will be a huge risk.

24/11/2020, 11:53 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): GCM is free.
24/11/2020, 11:53 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): And is the preferred way.
24/11/2020, 11:53 am - +91 77385 57601: GCM?
24/11/2020, 11:53 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Cloud functions
24/11/2020, 11:53 am - +91 77385 57601: Ohh
24/11/2020, 11:53 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Google Cloud Messaging.
24/11/2020, 11:53 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): WHAT?
24/11/2020, 11:53 am - +91 77385 57601: Ohh

24/11/2020, 11:54 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Do you know how push notifications work?
24/11/2020, 11:54 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): No.
24/11/2020, 11:54 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): The phone has to keep on listening to an endpoint for messages.
24/11/2020, 11:55 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Some port
24/11/2020, 11:55 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): So if every app implements it's own endpoint then that will put a lot of strain on the battery and the data.
24/11/2020, 11:55 am - +91 77385 57601: GCM is not Firebase messenging
24/11/2020, 11:56 am - +91 77385 57601: Ha I never knew it is free!
24/11/2020, 11:56 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): So Google has made several deals with phone and data providers to permanently keep one line open for precisely this purpose.
24/11/2020, 11:56 am - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Thank you SO much for sharing this!
24/11/2020, 11:56 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): So the phone has to listen to only one endpoint.
24/11/2020, 11:57 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): *almost free.
But the usage quotas are huge.
24/11/2020, 11:57 am - +91 77385 57601: nhi re Firebase pe dekha it is totally feee
24/11/2020, 11:57 am - +91 77385 57601: free

why does this run for any 8 digit hex number
25/11/2020, 6:50 pm - Farhan Irani (TSEC IT, SE): but gives an error for this 8C D3 AE 22
25/11/2020, 7:03 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): ```jshell> Integer.toString(Integer.MAX_VALUE, 16)
$1 ==> "7fffffff"```
25/11/2020, 7:04 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): You are exceeding the range of int.
25/11/2020, 7:05 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Use long instead:

```import java.util.*;

public class Main 
{
    public static void main(String a[])
    {
        Scanner s = new Scanner(System.in);
        // 3C 8C D3 AE 22 8C D3 AF 01

        String temp = s.nextLine();
        String combined = temp.replaceAll("\\s", "");

        System.out.println(combined.substring(0,8));
        String temp_data = Long.toBinaryString(Long.parseLong(combined.substring(0, 8), 16));
        while(temp_data.length() < 32)
            temp_data = "0" + temp_data;
            
        System.out.println("in binary : " + temp_data );
        System.out.println(" #--------------# ");
    }
}```
25/11/2020, 7:06 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): But a better solution is to read the header in 1 byte (2 hex characters) chuncks.

25/11/2020, 7:06 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Or simply expand each digit to binary.

28/11/2020, 8:28 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): OK, you have to understand the difference between a *PATH* and a *URI*.

28/11/2020, 8:29 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): ok....
28/11/2020, 8:30 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): URI stands for Uniform Resource Indicator.
28/11/2020, 8:30 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): yes...
28/11/2020, 8:30 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): *Uniform* means it has the same structure as a URL.
28/11/2020, 8:31 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): ok so I want the path,is there a function?
28/11/2020, 8:31 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): So applications that expect URLs don't have to have special logic for handling file paths.
28/11/2020, 8:31 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): im loading images using paths
28/11/2020, 8:31 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Be patient, I am coming to that.
28/11/2020, 8:31 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): ok
28/11/2020, 8:32 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): You will notice the same thing if you open a local file in a Web browser.

28/11/2020, 8:32 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Now, try to do ```filePath.toString()```

30/11/2020, 2:10 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Guys I accidentally merged some buggy PRs into my remote master branch,so I want to revert back to a previous commit in the master,so which will be the best way to do it?
Is there a way to do it from github without involving the local repo as my local repo is some commits ahead of remote?
30/11/2020, 2:11 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): please do help,college project hai and we have a deadlineüò¨üôà
30/11/2020, 2:12 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Which repo and which commit?
30/11/2020, 2:12 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): will send a pic
30/11/2020, 2:12 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Send a link.

30/11/2020, 2:12 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Ok
30/11/2020, 2:13 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): https://github.com/2tanayk/JavaFXTest/commits/master
30/11/2020, 2:21 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): OK, so you want to delete all the commits made on 29th?
30/11/2020, 2:21 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): yeah
30/11/2020, 2:22 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Do you want to keep a log?
30/11/2020, 2:22 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Or just delete the commits?
30/11/2020, 2:22 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): idk the consequences of doing eitherüôàüôà
30/11/2020, 2:22 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): basically the commits made on 29th have a version mismatch(Jdk 14)
30/11/2020, 2:23 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): so pulling them locally broke all the code,so I did a rollback locally
30/11/2020, 2:23 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Do you ever want to refer to the contents of those commits?
30/11/2020, 2:23 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): ???
30/11/2020, 2:23 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Do you have the class files in the repository?
30/11/2020, 2:24 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): no rather I would get a fresh PR done with only the relevant files
30/11/2020, 2:24 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): no
30/11/2020, 2:24 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): I use jdk 11
30/11/2020, 2:24 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): So?
30/11/2020, 2:24 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): The Java source files will be the same, right?
30/11/2020, 2:25 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): so pulling them gave issues,it said I will have to configure jdk 14
30/11/2020, 2:25 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): which I dont want to rn

30/11/2020, 2:27 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): So master/origin nahi karna?
30/11/2020, 2:27 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Local repo is all fine, remote needs to be reverted back to here
30/11/2020, 2:27 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): What???
30/11/2020, 2:28 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Your local and remote are not in sync?
30/11/2020, 2:28 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Nope some commits are yet to be pushed
30/11/2020, 2:29 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): So why are you not pushing them?
30/11/2020, 2:29 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): maybe because it will give PR issues
30/11/2020, 2:30 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): How??
30/11/2020, 2:30 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): <Media omitted>

30/11/2020, 2:31 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Don't do git reflog, do git log.
30/11/2020, 2:31 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Reflog is for getting back unpushed local commits.
30/11/2020, 2:31 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Yes thats why I had done it for a  rollback
30/11/2020, 2:32 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): No!!!
30/11/2020, 2:32 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Never use reflog to rollback.
30/11/2020, 2:32 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): F,what !?
30/11/2020, 2:32 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): See some commits were not reflecting in git log since I had not pushed them
30/11/2020, 2:33 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Try to use git revert.
30/11/2020, 2:33 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): No, no no
30/11/2020, 2:33 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): That failed since I had pulled
30/11/2020, 2:33 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): The buggy PR
30/11/2020, 2:33 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): That is not how git log works.
30/11/2020, 2:33 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): git log shows you the local history, regardless of the remote.
30/11/2020, 2:34 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): I was not able to see them,so I followed a StackOverflow article
30/11/2020, 2:34 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Just send me a picture of git log.
30/11/2020, 2:34 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Ok
30/11/2020, 2:34 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): <Media omitted>
30/11/2020, 2:35 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): OK, just to be clear, you are happy with the state of the local repository?
30/11/2020, 2:35 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Yes unless that git reflog wala rollback caused any issues
30/11/2020, 2:35 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): You were saying
30/11/2020, 2:35 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): And you want the remote to be exactly like the local repository?
30/11/2020, 2:35 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): No, it won't cause issues as such, it is just not good practice.
30/11/2020, 2:36 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Um no as I want to receive a PR pull and push
30/11/2020, 2:36 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Ok
30/11/2020, 2:36 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): That has nothing to do with this.
30/11/2020, 2:36 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Ok so If my teammate pulls,there shouldn't be issues right?
30/11/2020, 2:37 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): No, there will be issues in both cases.
30/11/2020, 2:37 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Bruh

30/11/2020, 2:38 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): If your teammates haven't made too many changes then I would suggest they delete and re-clone the repository.
30/11/2020, 2:38 am - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Nigga

What are your opinions?
06/12/2020, 5:12 pm - +91 77385 57601: IDEs are helping us write code faster and making us more productive.

At the same time, they are weakening our coding skills.

 *Main tweet*
06/12/2020, 5:36 pm - Prithvi Rohira (TSEC, CS): I feel algorithms and problem solving skills are more important than remembering syntax.
06/12/2020, 5:36 pm - +91 77385 57601: ++
06/12/2020, 5:39 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): I agree 100%
But I kinda feel that.
If you knew the syntax, I know you can always Google stuff.
But if you know the syntax, then it becomes a little bit more convenient.

06/12/2020, 7:21 pm - +91 77385 57601: Do you google the syntax of a for loop? Or you want to say something else?
06/12/2020, 8:10 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Not talking about stuff that basic.
06/12/2020, 8:10 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): C'mon
06/12/2020, 8:11 pm - +91 77385 57601: Toh konsa syntax bhai?
06/12/2020, 8:11 pm - +91 77385 57601: Programming logic samjhneko time jata hai...syntax is the most easy part
06/12/2020, 8:16 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Logic samjho bhai. Uske liye mana nahi kar raha hu.
But stuff like giving an example of Django:
How to capture the response of a POST request, handling the request and being able to insert data into database jaisi cheeze yaad hoti hai to better hota haii,
06/12/2020, 8:16 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Kitni baar/ kitni der tak google karte baithoge?
06/12/2020, 8:17 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): And all of this, I obviously mean to say comes with a little bit of practice and back and forth.

11/12/2020, 11:48 pm - +91 77385 57601: String.valueOf ?
11/12/2020, 11:48 pm - +91 98670 44401: Ya anything Double.valueOf(5.8)
11/12/2020, 11:48 pm - Ankit (TSEC, CS): isnt it same as .tostring()
11/12/2020, 11:49 pm - +91 77385 57601: Yes...mein ese he use kiya hu

11/12/2020, 11:54 pm - +91 77385 57601: In java int is primitive and Integer is a wrapper class
11/12/2020, 11:54 pm - +91 77385 57601: Pure guess, koi or confirm kar sake toh..better hai
11/12/2020, 11:54 pm - Ankit (TSEC, CS): vectors me tu sirf object add kar sakta hai
11/12/2020, 11:55 pm - +91 98670 44401: Ohk I think I understood so over here 'v' is a vector, so is there some weird property that it can store only objects that's why we convert everything into its wrapper classes?
11/12/2020, 11:55 pm - +91 77385 57601: Ig kabhi use nhi kiya
11/12/2020, 11:57 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): it will be converted to a double
11/12/2020, 11:57 pm - +91 98670 44401: Double wrapper class right?

12/12/2020, 12:06 am - +91 97739 65140: Yes
12/12/2020, 12:09 am - +91 97739 65140: Honestly, ye version updates yaad rakhna mushkil HOTA hai üòÇ
Unless you do coding in a specific version then you remember all the features of that version
12/12/2020, 12:10 am - +91 97739 65140: Koi app hai yeh version wise updates batane ke liye
It will help a lot during placement
12/12/2020, 12:11 am - +91 77385 57601: Saare features yaad bhi nhi hote haiü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüòÇ
12/12/2020, 12:13 am - +91 97739 65140: That is also true but after a while you get a hold on those features
But Konsa version se shuru hote hai that is quite a pain because every developer usually uses latest version of any sdk

12/12/2020, 2:32 am - +91 83292 66084: 3 ke vajah se unbalance hua n ismein....toh trace from root in the direction of 3 only two edges. You will get a RL type unbalancing. So for balancing it perform right rotate on 5. It will get you a RR type unbalancing and then rotate left 2 that part is balanced now. So attach remaining nodes to which it were connected and if some node remains then follow normal BST rules that small to left and big to right and place it
I hope it helps!

We were joined by Saurabh Daware and Shreyasi as well. They are amazing devs in the tech community!

We talked about:
- Saurabh's job as a front end engg at Razorpay (the interview process, the languages and frameworks used there, etc).
- Saurabh also told us how he made a compiler for a small language of his own! (It's available on NPM!) Milan gave his inputs on the topic as well.
- www.pointerpointer.com intrigued us for some time lol
- What is Svelte and how it compares with React.js.
- JSX
- Obscure languages like Haskell and Prolog.

19/12/2020, 10:21 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): It does good at containing the history, but the colleges can't teach, so it becomes very boring (YT makes it so interesting) and the syllabus hardly includes any new stuff, so that's not done as well.

So yes, you can't rely on it for IRL stuff, but if you try to learn the syllabus yourself, it does get interesting.

A big thank you to everyone who attended! We had Chirag Nayyar sir come in as well for a few hours!

We had a lot of fun and learnt a lot of stuff! The session lasted for 5 hrs 35 mins.

We talked about:
- College syllabus
- How the teacher's role is so pivotal in a student being able to gain interest in a subject
- Darshan showed us his simple feedback-collecting web app that he made using Flutter Web and Firebase. (https://aboutme-55236.web.app/)
- We were joined by Chirag Nayyar sir who told us a LOT about his life experiences, how we could be more confident and not lower our self-esteem when faced with failures, why the basics are more important than the evolving technologies and techniques to learn things in general and in Cloud. A lot of us asked him doubts.

28/12/2020, 12:52 am - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): *OTC CatchUp #7* was a good 5.5 hr discussion!

We were joined by Chirag Nayyar sir as well!

Topics discussed:
- Some attendees talked about their tech journey till now.
- Some people showcased their projects:
         - Darshan showed his poem-writing mobile app called _Heartry_, which he made using Flutter. A feature that everyone loved was the generation of a customizable image of the poems.
         - Tanay showed us the UI of a music-streaming Android app that he is working on.
         - We also saw a nice web app for Doctors which used HTML, Bootstrap and JS on the front end and PHP on the back end.
- Harsh talked about the recent Google and AWS outages, giving the details and reasons for the outage.
- We all unsuccessfully tried to hack a WordPress web site lol
- Darshan and Kartik tried to make some changes in the VS Code Dart extension. It did not go that well, but a lot was learnt in the process and that's what matters!
- We then watched some random videos and songs on YouTube for fun haha

I would like to thank all those who came to the 7th session and everyone who came for any of the 7 sessions till date as well! Thank you so much, it means a lot! We all learnt so much collectively! üíõ

29/12/2020, 5:13 pm - +91 99693 94098: Using deep learning. It's a pretty basic task
There may be three main reasons for doing this:
1. It helps expanding their categorisation algo since it can now extract text from the image and classify the post into a new category such as a meme or a subcategory of a meme
2. To avoid nudity and other illegal content
3. For context extraction. I had created an instagram bot banner for instagram's spam problems and that's what I had planned to do. Get the context of the post and check if the comment is related to it and not a sexting bot putting random stuff. I couldn't do this at the time because of Instagram's privacy policies but looks like they're trying to do the same thing. My deployed site isn't active at the moment but if you wish to check the code then you can refer to it here and I am assuming they're doing something on the same lines

29/12/2020, 5:14 pm - Pranav Dani: Wow
But then they can use it to map certain faces according to the tags that the user has made while posting the photos?
29/12/2020, 5:15 pm - +91 99693 94098: Yes they can
29/12/2020, 5:15 pm - Pranav Dani: So are they doing that secretly?

29/12/2020, 8:26 pm - Hardik Raheja (TSEC, CS): I mean. No offense but Sony isn't what it used to be. They still have quality in their products. I guess their supply chain and marketting is a lil messed up. Take the new Xperia phones for example
29/12/2020, 8:28 pm - Pranav Dani: Yeah that's correct but
If this news was correct
Then that would have implied microsoft has the monopoly over consoles (kinda) and all the camera expertise it has and then all the things that Sony has achieved goes to drain (not exactly)
Sony has good stuff but as you said marketing of certain products is a bit messed up
29/12/2020, 8:29 pm - Pranav Dani: But honestly all the hardware they make is actually really good
29/12/2020, 8:30 pm - Hardik Raheja (TSEC, CS): Nintendo would pounce at this opportunity. I doubt there would be a monopoly.

29/12/2020, 8:32 pm - Hardik Raheja (TSEC, CS): They have made a console before (Wii) and they are still functioning as a company. So if there was a monopoly being created. They would launch something to counter it. Maybe in the next generation of consoles but yeah.

03/01/2021, 12:54 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): OTC CatchUp #8 was an amazing SEVEN hour session!

We were joined by Saurabh Daware, Jai Dewani (from Raipur) and Arpit (from Kolkata).

Topics we discussed:
- General introductions.
- Project showcase:
         - Arpit, an Android app dev from Kolkata showed us his new note taking app (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.arpit.notify)
         - Darshan showed us the updates he made in his Flutter poem writing (and picture generation) app called _Heartry_.
         - Saurabh showed us his rocket game that works using mobile sensors. He emulated the sensor in the browser using the sensors tab in the DevTools. We didn't even know that such a tab existed! (https://eotm.ml/)
         - Anushka showed us her web app. She had done the front end for it and it looked so good! The back end was in PHP.
         - Jai showed us a lot of his projects like his WhatsApp script, his youtube-dl web app and more...
         - Dheeraj showed us a web app that he made in a hackathon. It was a hospital management system. He had used Bootstrap and Django.
- Harsh shared an issue that Tushar had raised in one of his repos and asked people for their opinions. Tushar was then told to open a PR as everyone liked his suggestions!
- Harsh showed everyone _PowerToys_ by Microsoft, a nice utility for Windows and its features. It's really handy!
- Darshan had opened a PR in the Flutter repo and showed us that. He will keep us posted on the progress with that.
- Pranav asked about hackathons as he has no experience with them and everyone shared their perspectives. There were a lot of funny hackathon stories shared as well üòÇ
- We watched random videos on YouTube lol
- We also saw some poorly written research papers.


With the completion of the 8th session, I am so proud to announce that OTC CatchUp has completed two months of continuous weekly sessions! Also, OTC is almost a year old now! ü•≥

Thank you so much to everyone who came for any of the sessions! I'll be announcing the date for the next session soon!

03/01/2021, 12:58 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): As most of the OTC CatchUp attendees are from TSEC, I would love to know your opinions on when the next session should be.

I will not be keeping a session next week (9th Jan).
Should the next session be on the 16th or the 23rd?
03/01/2021, 12:59 pm - Pranav Dani: 2nd year ka ig 18th tak hai so chooae karna padega ig?
03/01/2021, 1:00 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): I would prefer the 16th because I wouldn't prefer to keep a 2 week gap, but I know that you all have exams till the 18th, so I'm willing to do as y'all say.

SEs have exams till the 18th and TEs till the 16th.
03/01/2021, 1:01 pm - Pranav Dani: Ig keep on 16 also maybe?

There is a line between security n privacy invasion. If you are a suspect fir you need to prove yourself, toh privacy nhi. But bina matlab check karna is privacy invasion.

Idher I don't think ki privacy invade hua hai. Coz copy karna is not right thing to do and copy karte hue pakde jana is even worse.

Copy karo par savdani se. Don't use chrome to copy, because teachers ke liye sird chrome browser hai baki pata nhi unko.

10/01/2021, 3:34 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): *Short Summary ‚Äî* People will say that they don't need such privacy and security cause they don't have any important data. The thing is it's not about your explicit data- that is useless for most cases. It is about the implicit usage context and the metadata that your conversation exchanges carry, which can ultimately give away your security to data-breaches and hacks. If you are okay with that, you need to revaluate your opinion.

*Long Explanation ‚Äî*

The new privacy policy essentially allows WhatsApp to give your WhatsApp metadata to Facebook, i.e. what time you use WhatsApp at, when do you send a message, who you send it to, where you send it from and more, which helps Facebook as a targeted ad provider with their business at the expense of *your* data.

You might think this is just harmless, useless data but this is what Facebook actually does business in. On FB there is something called Promoted Posts, wherein you can target age groups in a locality who wear spectacles about a new product. That is how specific advertisers can go, and it is only going to get worse. Facebook talked about security and privacy being encoded in their DNA, and yet the. Cambridge Analytica breach happened. They violated their user agreement, they can do it again with WhatsApp if you accept the new policy. I'm going to talk you thorough why WhatsApp will become a lot more insecure than it already is ‚Äî

1. *WhatsApp Web ‚Äî* yes, it is convenient, but it is extremely susceptible to data breaches due to the nature of it and how security certificates are granted on a browser. The reason why signal doesn't have a web-based interface like WhatsApp Web is that it is insecure and breachable. End-to-End Encryption isn't effective on Whatsapp Web. The Signal Desktop app however, that is available for both Windows and Mac, IS secure.
2. *WhatsApp Backups ‚Äî* The backups that WhatsApp does aren't encrypted and WhatsApp can at any point in time access them under the legal demand of a subpoena or by breaching their agreements. This also causes the encryption to be worthless in the case of a breach of the cloud provider (AWS provides cloud services to iCloud, and Google Cloud provides Google Drive).
3. *Why Signal will never become WhatsApp ‚Äî* When Facebook bought WhatsApp, there was an EU deal where the term of the deal talked about keeping WhatsApp and Facebook as two separate apps. Facebook agreed to it, which is why they can't change their privacy policy in the UK or the EU. There's absolutely no legal groundwork that prevents Facebook from changing the privacy policy again in the future in other countries however. Signal does, because its entire premise is open-source, free, privacy focused messaging service that is non profit. Signal does not have tradable stocks because it's a nonprofit, it cannot be brought or sold by a company, ergo no financial incentive. Furthermore, it was given $50 million as a donation by one of the co-founders of WhatsApp when Facebook expressed their grand scheme of plans about rolling out their privacy policy into WhatsApp.
4. *Facebook owns WhatsApp ‚Äî* They violated agreements regarding the Cambridge Analytica Data Exploitation, they can do it again. except it will be worse now because WhatsApp is private communication, not a social wallfeed. Facebook has no social integrity, and they've openly stated in their legal policies that they will oblige with a subpoena. Apple stood against the FBI in 2015-16 legal dispute where they refused to turn up user data for legal request. Facebook will gladly turn up anything it has on you. Add that to the legal shadiness that Zuckerberg showed at the antitrust congressional hearing, as well as the Facebook-Cambridge hearings in court. He used a truthful technicality to ensure that he was not found directly guilty, mentioning how to the "best of his memory nothing wrong happened" and how he "did not remember what happened".
5. *Why not Telegram ‚Äî* Signal is already way more secure than WhatsApp and Telegram, and it will continue to develop especially because of how well people are adopting it. Telegram also uses data that is linked to you, although it is better than Telegram. Messages are also not encrypted by default, and group chats cannot be encrypted. There are also concerns about some Russian roots of Telegram, which is why Signal is the safest bet.

You may think that the metadata is useless, it is not. Some security analysts in fact call metadata as important as the actual data. It can facilitate data breaches and the worst part is that it WILL get worse in the future, because of what Facebook holds in its vision. Even if it was useless data, why give to a company that undermines your privacy and security time and time again for the sheer matter of their private benefit.

This shifting is just a wave, soon everything will settle down and everyone will be back on whatsapp. 
Because,
1. It's very hard to migrate people from here.
2. We might still need to use multiple apps. Some geeks might shift. Most of them won't. I don't have guts to put anything about it in my family grpü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Any idea, where I can get free domains?

For example, I've heard that 

``` .ml ```
&
``` .tk ``` 

domains are free...

Can someone help me out?
23/04/2021, 5:34 pm - +91 77385 57601: Freenom
23/04/2021, 5:35 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Vo mujhe usage rights dega ya phir ownership?

23/04/2021, 10:55 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): GitHub Student Developer Pack. One year free stuff.
23/04/2021, 10:55 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Also, for what do you want a custom domain? A project?
23/04/2021, 10:55 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Equipstat?
23/04/2021, 10:56 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Isn't Heroku/Netlify/Heroku+Netlify enough for a personal project, if that is what it is?
23/04/2021, 10:57 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): No. It isn't for Equipstat. 
It's for another project, wherein the custom domain is a part of the solution.
23/04/2021, 10:57 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Aah okay
23/04/2021, 10:57 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): What domain do you need?
23/04/2021, 10:58 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): .com
.tech
.me
.xyz
.party
.pizza

What are you looking for?
23/04/2021, 10:58 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): What is your budget?
23/04/2021, 10:59 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Oh you want a free one
23/04/2021, 11:00 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Do this for one year and then start paying, I guess ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
You might get a 2 year thing as well...
23/04/2021, 11:00 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): You see I am trying to build a URL Shortener.
The whole point of a shortener is to shorten a  URL.
Now if my domain itself is this huge friggin something.herokuapp.com or something,
Then it beats the purpose of a URL.

If I get ```.ly```, then that's cool.
Although I'm fine with ```.ml``` or ```.tk```

Budget: I ain't got a single dime.
23/04/2021, 11:00 pm - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): Yeah I presumed so
23/04/2021, 11:01 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): .... the purpose of a URL shortener*.....

Now it the user does put in http:// or https://
then it will work as expected
but if the user does not put http:// or https://

then, it adds http:// on its own.

25/04/2021, 7:23 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): What is so confusing?
25/04/2021, 7:23 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Also, why do you need the size?

25/04/2021, 7:25 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): This is related to how larger units of bytes work.
25/04/2021, 7:25 pm - +91 77385 57601: Ye nhi samjhaüòÇ
25/04/2021, 7:26 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Traditionally, 1 KB = 1024 bytes.
25/04/2021, 7:26 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): So, basically,
I have this feature where I am allowing the user to upload images
and I want to cap the image size at 2 MB
so we are basically trying to do si 
jo file object mil rahi hai
uski File.size property ki value compare karna cha rahe hai.
25/04/2021, 7:26 pm - Sahil A (TSEC, CS-B): Nice work
25/04/2021, 7:26 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): And 1 MB = 1024 KB.
25/04/2021, 7:26 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Thanks!
25/04/2021, 7:27 pm - +91 77385 57601: Toh demical ka kya bakchodi haiüòÇ
Non techie log samjh paye?
25/04/2021, 7:27 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): But the SI prefixes say that KB = 1000 b, and MB = 1000 KB.
25/04/2021, 7:28 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): File.size returns size in bytes
so, 
what do I compare it with that's the burning question here
25/04/2021, 7:28 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): So who the fuck do we believe
25/04/2021, 7:28 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): and
25/04/2021, 7:28 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): File.size decimal wala hai ya traditionally wala
25/04/2021, 7:28 pm - +91 77385 57601: 1024bytes
25/04/2021, 7:29 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): So now to avoid confusion, the new standard is KB = 1000 bytes, and KiB = 1024 bytes.
25/04/2021, 7:29 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Fullform of

KB and KiB ?
25/04/2021, 7:29 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): damn
25/04/2021, 7:30 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): I have had this question since class 10th
and aaj clear hua hai.
25/04/2021, 7:30 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Basically the normal prefixes like kilo, mega and giga will be base 10, and the new prefixes, kibi, mebi, gibi are base 2.
25/04/2021, 7:31 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): https://blog.digilentinc.com/mib-vs-mb-whats-the-difference/
25/04/2021, 7:31 pm - Pranav Dani: This is why, the hard drive or pendrives that ypu buy have less storage than mentioned on the packaging
25/04/2021, 7:32 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): File.size is given in bytes, so it is up to you to decide which standard you want to use.
25/04/2021, 7:32 pm - +91 77385 57601: Kya gajab nashe haiüò∂
25/04/2021, 7:32 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Sach me yaar.
25/04/2021, 7:33 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): If you want to restrict size to 2 MB then do <= 2 * 1000 * 1000.
If you want 2 MiB then do <= 2 * 1024 * 1024
25/04/2021, 7:36 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Sweet brooo

26/04/2021, 12:17 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): You should always define limits for user inputs otherwise someone will put in a 2 MB url, then what will you do?
26/04/2021, 12:18 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): @918451904417 also, you can edit the database directly, right?
26/04/2021, 12:18 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Okay.
So no not yet in the URL Shortener.
But Equipstat me we have restricted the user to upload only 5 photos, 2 MB max size.

But URL Shortener jo hai, isme I have to yet do it.
26/04/2021, 12:19 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Cause URL Shortener was a very quick project.
Slowly improving on it now....
26/04/2021, 12:19 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Yes.
26/04/2021, 12:19 pm - Tushar Nankani: What is a ```n``` MB url?
26/04/2021, 12:20 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): A URL which is toooooo long üòÖ
26/04/2021, 12:20 pm - Tushar Nankani: Oh.
26/04/2021, 12:20 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Just restrict the url to 2048 characters or so.
26/04/2021, 12:21 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): See how bit.ly and bit.do handle things.
26/04/2021, 12:21 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): You also have to be careful about loops.
26/04/2021, 12:22 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): For example, I'm not sure if I am correct 
But if you see, how the browser stores temporary images.
It encodes it to base 64,
And its url becomes the base 64 encoded output. 
Not really clear with the idea 
May be Kartik can correct/elaborate here.....

That URL is huuuugeeee.
26/04/2021, 12:22 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Yes
26/04/2021, 12:22 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): I realized thisüòÖ
26/04/2021, 12:22 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): What happens if someone does A -> B and B -> A.
26/04/2021, 12:22 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Yes.
I'll take a look.
26/04/2021, 12:22 pm - Tushar Nankani: Also, expiration of shortened URL.
26/04/2021, 12:23 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): <Media omitted>
26/04/2021, 12:23 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): This happens? üòÇ
26/04/2021, 12:23 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): You cannot prevent them 100%, but a good start is to disallow urls from the same domain.
26/04/2021, 12:23 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Please can yall raise issues for this?
26/04/2021, 12:23 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): I'll forget
26/04/2021, 12:24 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Meaning if the project is at https://a.xyz.com then don't allow urls from a.xyz
26/04/2021, 12:24 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Haa
26/04/2021, 12:24 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Got it
26/04/2021, 12:24 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): ..?
26/04/2021, 12:24 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): What???
26/04/2021, 12:24 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Exactly
26/04/2021, 12:25 pm - Tushar Nankani: I'll do that.

26/04/2021, 12:25 pm - Tushar Nankani: <Media omitted>
26/04/2021, 12:25 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): By temporary I mean, 
When you upload an image in a form.tab 
tak ...?
26/04/2021, 12:26 pm - Tushar Nankani: How many characters should be 2MB? How do we define it?
26/04/2021, 12:26 pm - +91 77385 57601: 2048 chars
26/04/2021, 12:26 pm - +91 77385 57601: Usse jyada konsa url hoga re
26/04/2021, 12:27 pm - +91 77385 57601: Get request mein jwt token daal raha hai?üòÇ
26/04/2021, 12:27 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): üòÇüòÇüòÇ
26/04/2021, 12:27 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Each character takes at least 1 byte, more for Unicode.
Don't forget text is also data, and needs space to be stored.
Usually, URLs are small enough that their size can be neglected, but you can construct urls that can break things.
26/04/2021, 12:27 pm - Tushar Nankani: Like Jitsi meetings, never expire. But Google Meet code does.
26/04/2021, 12:27 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Nahi, phir se calculate kar.
26/04/2021, 12:28 pm - +91 77385 57601: Jitsi meet reserved hota bhi nhi hai
26/04/2021, 12:28 pm - Tushar Nankani: I see.
26/04/2021, 12:28 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): No, that is a different concept.
26/04/2021, 12:28 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Yes.
26/04/2021, 12:28 pm - +91 77385 57601: Arre pata hai it is way less than 2mb but isse jyada chars hote hai kya?
26/04/2021, 12:29 pm - +91 77385 57601: 2048 chars i will me 2kb na?
26/04/2021, 12:30 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Assuming 2 MB = 2 * 2¬π‚Å∞ KB
= 2 * 2¬≤‚Å∞ bytes
= 2¬≤¬π ASCII letters at the most.
26/04/2021, 12:33 pm - Tushar Nankani: I get that.
26/04/2021, 12:33 pm - Tushar Nankani: I meant when a random shortened URL is generated, it checks whether the url is currently in use or not. If it is, it generates another random string. If we keep expirations there will be less clashes, just in case.
26/04/2021, 12:33 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Yes. That is also a great idea!
26/04/2021, 12:33 pm - Tushar Nankani: I see.
26/04/2021, 12:35 pm - +91 77385 57601: Hmm maybe user ko life time ka option deü§î
26/04/2021, 12:36 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Yes.
26/04/2021, 12:36 pm - +91 77385 57601: N random strings ko clash karna bhaut muskil hai
26/04/2021, 12:36 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): It can be like bit.ly does
26/04/2021, 12:36 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): For reference, this is the approximate size of all Shakespeare's plays.
26/04/2021, 12:37 pm - Tushar Nankani: See, if you want to monetize this. (I prefer not to.) Give this to the premium users.
26/04/2021, 12:37 pm - Vedant Manuja (TSEC, CS): <Media omitted>
26/04/2021, 12:37 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): If you don't create an account 
Then you will only be able to generate a URL with random string.

If you create an account  you can set expiration date, customize back part, see click count etc...
26/04/2021, 12:37 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): @919987663816 ...
26/04/2021, 12:37 pm - +91 77385 57601: Arre abhi itna users kaha...jab badega tab karte hai ye
26/04/2021, 12:37 pm - +91 77385 57601: Haaa
26/04/2021, 12:38 pm - Tushar Nankani: Oh okay.
26/04/2021, 12:38 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): That's how bit.ly does it
26/04/2021, 12:38 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Some websites embed base64 versions of generated images in the url to avoid storing data server side.
26/04/2021, 12:38 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Ek baar bit.do dekh le.
26/04/2021, 12:38 pm - +91 77385 57601: WhatüòÇüòÇ
26/04/2021, 12:38 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Mujhe unka implementation accha laga.
26/04/2021, 12:39 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): And the bestest part MongoDB is,
There is no fixed structure. 
So that helps a lot while adding new stuff.
26/04/2021, 12:39 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): YES

26/04/2021, 12:40 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): When you are uploading images in a form
So the browser stores it like this 
Till the time the form is submitted.
26/04/2021, 12:40 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): (Ignore the image, it is my DBMS project's Schema)
26/04/2021, 12:40 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): No, that is a choice.
26/04/2021, 12:40 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Accha
26/04/2021, 12:41 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): You don't have to store images in base64.
26/04/2021, 12:41 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): You can send the binary file directly to the server.
26/04/2021, 12:41 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): We (me and @918329266084 )
Saw this where we were creating this feature drop files to upload
26/04/2021, 12:42 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): But it is easier to handle strings instead of raw binary, so a lot of applications use base64 as an alternative.
26/04/2021, 12:44 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): So our approach was,
Ek drop zone hoga 
Jispe there is a drop event listener
Then the dropped images were stored by using readAsDataURL
Something like that.
26/04/2021, 12:44 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Yes. Exactly.
26/04/2021, 12:44 pm - Tushar Nankani: Oh okay.

26/04/2021, 6:19 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): @918879480965 Another slight nitpick, you should put async/defer scripts in head, otherwise there is no point.

26/04/2021, 6:29 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Try to go lower, one abstraction at a time.
26/04/2021, 6:30 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Why are you using express? Why are you using node? What is a client? What is a server?
26/04/2021, 6:30 pm - +91 88794 80965: i guess i am well versed about most of those things
26/04/2021, 6:30 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): I mean try to achieve the same result without express.
26/04/2021, 6:31 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Then try to do it without node, just Apache and shell scripts.
26/04/2021, 6:31 pm - +91 88794 80965: i see will do, sometime later... now i am into different things
26/04/2021, 6:31 pm - +91 88794 80965: hmm.. interesting, sure will try that as well

26/04/2021, 10:34 pm - +91 97690 16588: Is it because of the wrong method. It is using get and should use Post?

26/04/2021, 10:48 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Huh.
26/04/2021, 10:48 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Usually, this happens when you set an incorrect access token.
26/04/2021, 10:48 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Using docker login.
26/04/2021, 10:48 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): But it might have been a network error.

26/04/2021, 10:49 pm - +91 97690 16588: Yeah
26/04/2021, 10:50 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Then it might be an issue with the build config.
26/04/2021, 10:50 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): What files do you have in the folder?
26/04/2021, 10:51 pm - +91 97690 16588: Just the dockerfile in the buildenv folder of the directory for now
26/04/2021, 10:51 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Just the dockerfile? Nothing else?
26/04/2021, 10:51 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Check for hidden files as well.
26/04/2021, 10:51 pm - +91 97690 16588: Okay
26/04/2021, 10:53 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Also, side note, you should try to put all the installs in one command, and chain commands with &&\.
26/04/2021, 10:53 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Every step in the dockerfile adds another layer, which will increase the size of the final image.
26/04/2021, 10:54 pm - +91 97690 16588: Right
26/04/2021, 10:54 pm - +91 97690 16588: Thanks for the help
26/04/2021, 10:54 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Like this.

30/04/2021, 5:07 pm - +91 97681 67131: Not exactly. It‚Äôs few important features like your BIOS should support Intel Virtual Technology and allows you to disable secure boot and some other such things. (This is all for intel motherboards ) but yes after this all also all things will not work correctly. Most issues come with PCIE cards you might have so your audio card, etc they more often don‚Äôt work which is a deal breaker and Hackintosh‚Äôs are sluggish due to Clover and other such bootloaders üòÇ. So a lot of pain and ruining a completely good laptop is not worth but some spare laptop this can be tried on
30/04/2021, 5:09 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): OR you can bypass all that and run a light linux distro, and install MacOS in a VM. You do loose one core and some computing power though, so not the best if the PC is not very powerful.
Linus Tech Tips has a good guide to do this.
30/04/2021, 5:09 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Also, I absolutely LOVE the new iMac designs, very sleek.
30/04/2021, 5:10 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): I don't really like Apple's business practices or software philosophy but credit where credit is due.
30/04/2021, 5:10 pm - +91 97681 67131: Yes that‚Äôs gr8 but I find them worst than Hackintosh for XCode due to less RAM üòÇ
30/04/2021, 5:11 pm - +91 97681 67131: Yuk absolutely garbage if they had just got rid of that ugly chin
30/04/2021, 5:12 pm - +91 97681 67131: Yes we don‚Äôt like any companies business policies üòÇ. They are into business of money making and no company is truly righteous after all they want to earn trillions
30/04/2021, 5:13 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Don't use them for development, just for compiling.
30/04/2021, 5:15 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Yes, but some companies are worse than others.
Samsung is also a mobile manufacturer, but they don't id every part and brick the phone if a replacement one is installed.
30/04/2021, 5:15 pm - +91 97681 67131: Simulators are issue not even compiling and any developer might just have 1 Screen Size. But ideally it should be tested on multiple üòÖ
30/04/2021, 5:16 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Yes, the chin is unfortunate.
30/04/2021, 5:16 pm - +91 97681 67131: Yes agree. But the part of ID ing prevents a theft or a stolen device not to be sold or used even as parts

30/04/2021, 5:19 pm - Hardik Raheja (TSEC, CS): One thing I really don't understand about Apple is why can't they use standard display resolutions, The iMac/Mac has resolutions like 4.5K, 5K and 6K, even though they are not standard why can't they stick with one?

30/04/2021, 5:27 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): That would be OK as there was some way of using third party parts, or even to buy parts from Apple and replace them yourself.
Right now, you are at apple's mercy, and they push for replacement instead of repairing devices.

30/04/2021, 7:07 pm - +91 97681 67131: Also on the other hand not allowing anyone else to sell your parts is a great buisness as u being a oem can sell parts at higher prices so this too

30/04/2021, 7:10 pm - +91 77385 57601: Which iPhone?
30/04/2021, 7:10 pm - +91 97681 67131: Nope actually you can just iCloud lock a device rendering a motherboard of a stolen device completely useless
30/04/2021, 7:11 pm - +91 97681 67131: In olden days maybe could be easy but to keep fingerprint data more secure and really just get more control over all parts put in their iPhone they have made it lot tough
30/04/2021, 7:13 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Yes, but what about the camera, speakers, body, display, fingerprint reader... ?
30/04/2021, 7:14 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): The primary reason for tying parts together is to prevent them from being sold separately.

30/04/2021, 7:25 pm - +91 97681 67131: But some tech companies earn from data some earn from this. Both are cheap and useless ways to loot customers. But point is for innovation you need research which needs money. And such methods provide money for that.

02/05/2021, 3:26 pm - +91 83292 66084: {} this represents object literal.
And you have enclosed the parr2.includes(e) in {}
02/05/2021, 3:27 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Arrow function hai na
02/05/2021, 3:28 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): (parameter)=>{}
02/05/2021, 3:30 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): Oh wait  is it :
(e)=>{}
02/05/2021, 3:32 pm - +91 83292 66084: If you remove the return keyword then arrow functions work like, as there is only one sentence it returns it. So you don't need brackets here.
02/05/2021, 3:33 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): yes it works without braxkets
02/05/2021, 3:34 pm - +91 83292 66084: Brackets ke vajah se it filters an object from parr array. As there ain't any object. It gives empty array.
02/05/2021, 3:34 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): is return compulsory with brackets?
02/05/2021, 3:35 pm - +91 83292 66084: No if there is a single statement and you want to be executed. Remove the brackets and make it oneline.
02/05/2021, 3:35 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): ok
02/05/2021, 3:35 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): ty

02/05/2021, 3:37 pm - +91 83292 66084: Yes this means a code block to execute. This works fine

02/05/2021, 3:42 pm - +91 83292 66084: You mean everything concise?
02/05/2021, 3:42 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): where there is no static type checking

The 2nd answer is really good
02/05/2021, 5:16 pm - Tanay Kamath (TSEC, CS): 2nd best*
02/05/2021, 7:30 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Duck typing is when a language doesn't enforce types, if an object has the required properties during runtime, then it everything works.

For example, in JavaScript, if you do console.log(a.length) then the program will work if a is a String, Set, Array or {length: 5}
02/05/2021, 7:31 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): The runtime will not enforce that a has the length property or not.

Mei web phishing website bana raha hun

Humne bootstrap ka tempelate hi utha liya hai

Abb actually mujhe woh backend se connect karna hai django ke through

Mere app mei khali ek input box hai jo back end mei catch hoga aur sidha url input hoga

Problem is maine kabhi django kaam nahi kiya mujhe exactly bata sakta hai ki

Mujhe karna kya hai

Mera app aise kaam karega
Jab website access karengay toh django homepage throw karna chahiye , waha se input jab liya django catch karke sirf ek input string back end python program ko.dena hai uske baad uss ka jo result hai ussi ke according frontend pe HTML page throw karna hai.

- When uploading scripts, try to add a GIF or an MP4 of the script in action. In the README. 

- Local setup
Your script includes adding a local path. So, add steps to run the script on your local machine. 

- Generalization 
Right now, the script takes care of the crypto scam. 
Add steps how to generalize it. Like add url to ```posted_url.txt``` and altering ```spamwords``` in the script and so on.
09/05/2021, 9:15 pm - Mittul Dasani (TSEC, CS): I‚Äôll add some ss of the bot in action

*üí•Candid expressionüí•*, an organisation started by Me and my friends.

üëâIt is a platform which provides everyone an opportunity to express themselves. 

üëâEvery month we come up with  new themes around which creators can submit their expressions. It can be anything like:
  ‚Ä¢ Paintingsüé®
  ‚Ä¢ Blogsüë©‚Äçüíª
  ‚Ä¢ Songsüé∂
  ‚Ä¢ Poems, etc.

üëâSo during these tough times we as an organisation have planned to launch the campaign *#LetArtHealYou* and the details for the same are shared below.

üëâLooking forward for all of you to be part of this campaign and help out a bit in this pandemic while still having a good time.

18/05/2021, 10:23 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): 3 asynchronous functions.

18/05/2021, 10:31 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): because, latest wala class apply hota h
18/05/2021, 10:31 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): which is blue
18/05/2021, 10:31 pm - Tushar Nankani: Yes. Absolutely correct.
18/05/2021, 10:31 pm - Tushar Nankani: <Media omitted>
18/05/2021, 10:32 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): green??

18/05/2021, 10:32 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): because, element is specified?
Takes precedence over general class?
18/05/2021, 10:33 pm - +91 88886 17421: Last m jo likhte woh dominant rehta h na?
18/05/2021, 10:33 pm - +91 88886 17421: Like it take over the previous one?
18/05/2021, 10:33 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): that was the case in previous question
18/05/2021, 10:33 pm - Tushar Nankani: Yes, but _specificity_ overrides generic classes.
18/05/2021, 10:33 pm - +91 93256 43272: Green
18/05/2021, 10:33 pm - +91 88886 17421: Toh uske hisab se waha Red Aana chaiye na?
18/05/2021, 10:34 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): So, green right?
18/05/2021, 10:34 pm - +91 93256 43272: Nope more specific is div.red

18/05/2021, 10:36 pm - Tushar Nankani: Specificity comes in picture
when multiple css declarations target same element.

So here .blue and .red target same element
so specifity is calculated, whereas ```div.red``` is more specific.
18/05/2021, 10:36 pm - +91 88284 70904: Nope here both have same spcificity 
So jo latest hai vo apply hota
18/05/2021, 10:37 pm - Tushar Nankani: Yes.
18/05/2021, 10:37 pm - +91 93256 43272: How u guys change the font?? Like u did in that div.red

He said, save up upto 6 months of your salary. For your emergencies/if you lose your job/if you have to move.

And,  if you feel a bit adventurous, take only 10% and only 10%, put it into BTC or ETH.

Make sure you are not putting more than 10%

The ones that kartik said.

And include should should at the top. Functions should be at the top. Yes. But before calling the functions. 

You also haven't passed your parameters to ```sum``` .

26/05/2021, 3:11 pm - Tushar Nankani: You have to pass parameters a and b. 

Call it using ```sum(a, b)```
26/05/2021, 3:11 pm - +91 77385 57601: Voh flutter generated hai...

Good formatted code helps you and OTHERS debug your code.

27/05/2021, 9:05 pm - Hardik Raheja (TSEC, CS): I am not extremely well versed with the rules/concepts of open-source so I have a few doubts about making it open-source
a) This friend of mine has no interest in learning coding in the near future and will need to have someone who will be responsible for any glitches in the site and handling of the repo
b) If all the code is available online, how simple will it be for a scammer to create a clone and extract money from people (This is risky imo because  this can cause damage to the reputation)
27/05/2021, 9:07 pm - Hardik Raheja (TSEC, CS): c) There will be some kind of deadline that needs to be fulfilled for making the site, will this be possible to achieve with open-source?
27/05/2021, 9:08 pm - +91 77385 57601: Point hai thoda...agar koi bug raha toh exploit karna bhi easy hoga
27/05/2021, 9:09 pm - Hardik Raheja (TSEC, CS): These are my doubts, before I convince him to open-source
27/05/2021, 9:11 pm - Hardik Raheja (TSEC, CS): For point b, let us say the website directly does not have a payment link and it is sent by some other means, but there needs to be some safeguard so an exact clone is not _too easy_
27/05/2021, 11:08 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): @919820061797 
b) Unless the website includes a backend (rarely needed for such a simple site) then ALL the code will be visible, in plaintext, to anyone who visits the website and presses Ctrl + Shift + I, so just putting the code on GitHub won't be an issue.
FYI, you can clone any static website with minimal effort using ```wget --spider <url>```.
27/05/2021, 11:08 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): For a and c, I think we can take collective responsibility.
In fact, having it open will make it easier for new developers to contribute.

28/05/2021, 12:07 am - Hardik Raheja (TSEC, CS): Will have to include a backend from the description given to me. So how should this point be resolved?
28/05/2021, 12:08 am - Hardik Raheja (TSEC, CS): Collective responsibility to build is fine. But there needs to be someone who is managing it na. As I said, what do you do in case of a glitch. Who does he contact?
28/05/2021, 12:11 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Are you sure?
I am doubtful you will need a backend, and even if you do, you will most likely use Firebase or a similar service.
28/05/2021, 12:13 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Collective responsibility means if there is a glich, everyone will take a look as soon as they can.
Unless he has a long-term contract, which is expensive, it will be faster than if he has to find someone new each time.
28/05/2021, 12:24 am - Hardik Raheja (TSEC, CS): As someone who owns an organization. Think of this, there is a glitch on your website, do you send a message/go on calling people _hoping_ someone will look at it. 
OR 
You call one person who can lead and be held at least somewhat accountable to *get someone* to look at it immediately and resolve it ASAP
28/05/2021, 12:24 am - Hardik Raheja (TSEC, CS): It _might_ be faster you can't be sure
28/05/2021, 12:29 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): > You call one person who can lead and be held at least somewhat accountable to *get someone* to look at it immediately and resolve it ASAP

That is called a support contract.
They usually cost a good ‚Çπ25-30k per month at the minimum, whether there is a glitch or not.
28/05/2021, 12:31 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): OR

You have a list of people you can contact if something goes horribly wrong, and the probability that at least one of them will be free is much higher.
28/05/2021, 12:48 am - Tushar Nankani: The way I see it, there are three ways to go about it. 

- Open source it, completely. And believe in the spirit of open source and not care if the code is going to be copied or modified.  
In the end, a lot of softwares are open source, and we don't worry about their clones after all. 


2. Create a private organization on GitHub, give the task to a few developers. Because sometimes, a few developers can get a lot work done, rather than contributors marking PRs and then maintainers reviewing them takes most of the time. So I feel, open sourcing it completely might not be the right decision here.

3. If it is a one time paid gig, just give them what they are looking for, a developer who builds a website. And delivers it to them. With full responsibility.


But if the NGO wants support contacts, as Kartik told, they might cost a lot to them.

So, I feel going with the 2nd option would be best. Probability wise, at one point of time, one developer would at least be there to take a look at the issue. And take responsibility. Rather than just one or everyone if we make it open source.
28/05/2021, 12:50 am - Tushar Nankani: Also, reference video: https://youtu.be/YIL5fuAUPiA
28/05/2021, 12:53 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): > not care if the code is going to be copied or modified.  

I repeat, a website without a custom backed gains almost nothing from being close-source.
You have to serve the source files anyway if you want to make the website public.
28/05/2021, 12:54 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Remember, this is not a startup.
The website is not a product, it won't have anything too innovative.
28/05/2021, 12:55 am - Tushar Nankani: I get that. I think he mentions some points that might seem relevant after all.
28/05/2021, 1:01 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): > If it is a one time paid gig, just give them what they are looking for, a developer who builds a website. And delivers it to them. With full responsibility.

That is a support contract.
A one-time job means you deliver the website and client confirms it is working.
Anything after that, anything else is considered a separate contract, although trivial bugs found within 5-7 days are usually fixed as a curtesy.
28/05/2021, 1:01 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): OK, just pointing it out.
28/05/2021, 1:05 am - Tushar Nankani: I see. Thanks for clarifying!
28/05/2021, 1:07 am - Tushar Nankani: It is upto the NGO to weigh the pros and cons to come up with a decision. @919820061797 

Whatever the case, we'll be in on it if any help is needed.

28/05/2021, 2:44 pm - Hardik Raheja (TSEC, CS): This is a good point
28/05/2021, 2:50 pm - Hardik Raheja (TSEC, CS): Open-source it completely, as per the video you've sent Tushar, there needs to be someone who manages that Open Source project, now I don't know too much about web-dev to take that up, also there needs to be at least a few volunteers that will take up the collective responsibility to complete it on time.

For option 2, if no one is reviewing the code before it gets published and as @918080142783 suggested we involve newer developers too, there needs to be some basic quality of the site/code that needs to be maintained, how does that get achieved?

3. They don't mind that too, but if it _can_ be open-sourced, which I am _for_ given my doubts are addressed, that would be better, now that I look at it

I can tell you from experience that open sourcing the website will is almost gaurenteed to provide huge benefits, with little to no downsides.

If you provide the actual details then we can be 100% sure, and I personally will inform you if any part will be risky to open source.

If you have any other questions then I will try to address them on OTC.
28/05/2021, 3:14 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): If possible ask that NGO person to join OTC.
28/05/2021, 3:15 pm - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): It is better if he can clarify his doubts himself.
28/05/2021, 3:17 pm - Hardik Raheja (TSEC, CS): I'll have to give him some brief before telling him to join and if my doubts aren't clear how should I convince him? So that is why I was trying to clarify my doubts first

29/05/2021, 1:52 am - Hardik Raheja (TSEC, CS): Confirmed about this, it's a yes.
29/05/2021, 1:53 am - +91 77385 57601: Chalo sahi..
29/05/2021, 1:53 am - Hardik Raheja (TSEC, CS): I think the private organization way should be a good idea so that people from here can volunteer and contribute
29/05/2021, 1:53 am - Hardik Raheja (TSEC, CS): Making it open-to-all can be making it vulnerable for _future_ bugs
29/05/2021, 1:55 am - Hardik Raheja (TSEC, CS): @918080142783 you fine with this + private organization ka idea?
29/05/2021, 1:56 am - +91 77385 57601: farak kya hota hai dono mein?
29/05/2021, 1:57 am - Hardik Raheja (TSEC, CS): As far as I understand it, people included within the organization can read the code and send pull requests, while as a public repo, it's open for all
29/05/2021, 1:58 am - +91 77385 57601: but bahar se PRs le sakte hai na...?
29/05/2021, 1:58 am - +91 77385 57601: ayenge nhi but y not?
29/05/2021, 2:00 am - Hardik Raheja (TSEC, CS): If we can help developers here grow, and at the same time avoid the security risks for any vulnerabilities found in the future, I feel it's _slightly_ safer that way aur kuch nahi
29/05/2021, 2:04 am - Hardik Raheja (TSEC, CS): Soch agar @919769016588 jaisa koi bahar wala hua, unethical slightly toh woh toh code dekh ke website ke vulnerabilities nikal dega, no need to do a million tests on the site. Correct me if I'm wrong here
29/05/2021, 2:09 am - +91 77385 57601: but log dekh he nhi sakte toh opensource ka matlab kya?
29/05/2021, 2:28 am - Hardik Raheja (TSEC, CS): Mere dimag mei ye aaya, following @919987663816 's suggestion ki whoever wishes to contribute and learn from the code in good-faith, should be given access to it, so that the site is not vulnerable to any foreign hackers wishing to attack it don't make a treat out of it, front-end ko fully open-source karna is fine, backend at least ko private repo of the organization (of whoever wishes to volunteer is a part of) ho.
29/05/2021, 2:36 am - +91 77385 57601: Backend theek hai..but frontend ko open rakhna..
29/05/2021, 2:38 am - Hardik Raheja (TSEC, CS): My thoughts exactly
29/05/2021, 2:46 am - Harsh Kapadia (TSEC IT, SE): I am attending the 2nd meetup here today.

29/05/2021, 2:48 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): No.
29/05/2021, 2:48 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Again, no.
29/05/2021, 2:50 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): I repeat (again) that the probability of someone exploiting a bug is much smaller than someone contacting you with a fix.
29/05/2021, 2:50 am - Kartik Soneji (TSEC, CS): Please @919820061797 let us discuss this on OTC.

- He means to say that he tried entering Japanese characters and that he appreciates that he was able to do that. He appreciates that his local language is supported. 

OR

- The real meaning might me lost in translation and he is requesting that Darshan Makes his app compatible with Japanese characters. 

Although, judging by the number of stars he has given, I leaning more towards 1.

I recently released two of my datasets on Kaggle. If you are interested or are looking for new datasets to mess around with then do check them out!
1. Royalty-Free Audio Dataset:
This dataset consists of 1500+ hours of Royalty-free music data sampled from Youtube. You can find it here: https://www.kaggle.com/darshan1504/royaltyfree-audio-dataset
2. IMDB Movie Reviews 2021
A fresh new IMDB dataset containing 5400+ reviews specifically for movies released in 2021. Discover it out here: https://www.kaggle.com/darshan1504/imdb-movie-reviews-2021

And let me point out, he has used Scrapera to scrape the second data set. 

Scrapera is a python package built by @919022839414 himself üôåüèª

On a side note, IMDB datasets of this magnitude might not be enough for even performing transfer learning BERT. Though this shouldn't stop you from using this dataset with other available sources

01/06/2021, 2:49 pm - Hardik Raheja (TSEC, CS): Ig it edges quite a bit into the background of ML. At least that's what the application section gave me the idea.
01/06/2021, 2:49 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Let's have a meeting for those who are interested and let's make an informed decision.
01/06/2021, 2:49 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): SE Comps.
01/06/2021, 2:50 pm - Tushar Nankani: Yeah.

01/06/2021, 2:52 pm - Hardik Raheja (TSEC, CS): Question tho, since they are telling us to *choose* an option won't it be unfair not to give us any one we choose
01/06/2021, 2:54 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): See they can't keep multiple electives I guess.
They don't know how to frame the question. 
They should have written as give your preference.
01/06/2021, 2:54 pm - Hardik Raheja (TSEC, CS): Syllabus for our year has also changed, could it be something to do with that?
01/06/2021, 2:55 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Yeah. Maybe.
In all these changes, one thing which stays constant is we still can not depend on our teachers to learn anything valuable no matter what we choose üòì
01/06/2021, 2:57 pm - Hardik Raheja (TSEC, CS): That is true, unfortunately. However these courses can help in any future studies/job so it is important
01/06/2021, 2:58 pm - Dheeraj Lalwani (TSEC, CS): Yes. Absolutely.
01/06/2021, 3:03 pm - +91 88284 70904: We can select only one right?

01/06/2021, 8:30 pm - Vivek (TSEC, CS): so after this form they will select the topic which is selected by majority of students right?
01/06/2021, 8:30 pm - Vivek (TSEC, CS): or for each student subject will be different based on what he has chosen
01/06/2021, 8:31 pm - Ankit (TSEC, CS): this seems more likely
01/06/2021, 8:31 pm - +91 99693 94098: I think this varies from person to person. We have Tanuja and Vaishali ma'am for ML in sem 6 and they're good

i genuinely have a question
01/06/2021, 8:34 pm - +91 99693 94098: Yes. Our HOD, Tanuja ma'am told us that there need to be atleast 40 students out of 120 (this is what was for us) which opt for a subject for it to be considered
01/06/2021, 8:34 pm - Vivek (TSEC, CS): ok
01/06/2021, 8:35 pm - Kritanjali Jain (TSEC, CS): Bas because if i dont get what they teach but they are strict on attendance assignments stuff
